            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongſt many weighty and ſoul pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing ſentences that ye will find in theſe following Sermons, this is one; <hi>That the profeſſors of this age, whether they go to Heaven or Hell, they will be the greateſt debtors that ſhal be in either place: the one to the free grace of God, and the other to his Juſtice.</hi> And certainly, if we ſpeak of theſe in this time, whoſe bleſſed lot it ſhal be to inherit the Kingdom, they cannot but acknowledge themſelves indebted to his love, above all that have gone before them, for waſhing them from ſuch ugly pollutions, as this generation hath been defiled with; for bringing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through ſuch great tribulations, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving them in the midst of ſo great tentations, and dangerous ſnares, and have encompaſſed them; yea, and ſtill keeping in the light before them, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of ſo many blaſts (if we may ſo ſpeak) from all the four winds of Hell to blow it out. And on the other hand, if we ſhal ſpeak of theſe who in this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſhal periſh, aſſuredly their debt unto Divine Juſtice must be exceeding great, above all who are gone down to the pit before them; becauſe the rod of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:178801:3"/> their mercies will be found to have been many Cubits longer, and many Cubits broader, then theirs who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the preceeding ages, and the great things that the Lord hath wrought in our days, have born a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter teſtimony against the wickedneſs, hardneſs, and atheiſm of this time, then of many former. But above all, the great meaſure of Goſpel light that he hath no leſs plentifully offered then wonderfully preſerved to this generation, beyond all our Anceſtors, hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly made the ſin of theſe who ſhal utterly reject their own mercy ſo out of meaſure ſinful; and their unbelief ſo exceedingly inexcuſable, that their guilt muſt needs juſtifie <hi>Corazin</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida,</hi> or <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah, in that day when every man ſhal give account of himſelf to God.</hi> And amongst the many preaching-witneſſes, that (alace! we are afraid) ſhal compear <hi>in that day</hi> againſt many yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in <hi>their pleaſures, and dead while they live; This now glorified Author</hi> cannot but be one, whoſe teſtimony muſt be very condemning, eſpecially to the vain, looſe, negligent, and time waſting youth in this age: For when he was firſt drawn forth to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, he was but a youth indeed, ſcarce twenty years compleat; for within that age, that by the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this Church (except in caſe of more than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon abilities, which indeed he had) is required for entring in that great and holy Calling: And for the ſpace of two years after (which was all the time that the Church enjoyed his labour) he was helped to preſs the truths and threatnings of God ſo home upon the conſciences of his hearers, that as it was obſerved
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:178801:3"/> of him; by one of his moſt learned and pious Collea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus, <hi>Maſter Durham,</hi> who is now in glory with him, he did many times cauſe the hair of their head to ſtand up: The Lord not only hereby verifying his Word, that he can <hi>take the weak things of the World to confound the ſtrong; and out of the mouths of babes can perfect his own praiſe:</hi> but deſigning alſo (as would ſeem of purpoſe) to ſend a boy out of the ſchool for a reprover of the ſluggiſhneſs of his people, that thereby the aged might be the more aſhamed, and the younger more afraid. Neither do we think that this was all; but truly when we conſider what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of graces, gifts, and experiences the Lord did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon ſo young a perſon: and then with what hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, ſelf-denial, gravity, prudence, diligence, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and moderation, he was helped to manage theſe Talents, during that ſhort time of his Miniſtry. It may be justly conceived that the Lord brought him forth to be a great conviction, even to many of us in the Miniſtry, who came into our Maſters Vineyard long before him and will go out behind him. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to us it looketh ſomewhat like the Lords taking up of the <hi>little child,</hi> and ſetting him amongſt the midſt of his contending Diſciples, in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe times, that even they who would be greatest amongſt us, might be the leaſt, and ſee ſomewhat of their own weakneſs.</p>
            <p>As to the little Piece, whatever ye ſhal find in it, it hath this to ſay for it ſelf, that whereas many wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings in the World do intrude themſelves upon the Preſs, yet this the Preſs hath violently thruſt into the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:178801:4"/> world: For ſome young Student, from his good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the edification of the Lords people, and (no doubt) from his high esteem of the precious Author his memory, having given into the Preſs a copy of ſome of theſe Sermons, being only notes taken from his mouth when he preached them; no ſooner were they ſeen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, but all the Preſſes in the Nation fell a labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring about them, ſo that (if we miſtake not) in leſs then two or three months time, three or four Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions were caſt of, yet all of them ſo imperfect and maimed, that howbeit the excellency of the matter, and the freſh remembrance of the worthy Author, his name made him very ſweet to many (eſpecially thoſe who had heard him preach) yet the unſuitable dreſs wherein they appeared, and their mistakes of the firſt Writers (they being hard lyable to take up every thing as it was ſpoken) occaſioning diverſe mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial failings in the ſenſe, beſides leſſer faults, could not but be a trouble to thoſe who were acquainted, not onlie with the ſingular graces, but parts alſo of the eminent Youth. This gave occaſion to ſome friends to ſpeak a little what way theſe prejudices, which both the Truth and the Authors name might ly under, by theſe uncorrect Impreſſions. And finding that the Copy which by providence the worthie young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, who was his wife, had lying by her, though it was but Notes taken from his mouth, yet was the moſt correct that could be found: And that it alſo did contain the whole purpoſes that had been preached upon the Texts; Yea, the whole purpoſes concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Faith that he had preached, according to that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:178801:4"/> method propoſed in the firſt of the Sermons formerly publiſhed. This was undertaken to be reviſed by ſome, who albeit none of the fitteſt for the imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet rather or nothing ſhould be done in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, were content to beſtow ſome hours upon it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as other neceſſary employme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts would permit. And now having ſought out all the Notes of theſe Sermons, which we could find from other hands, and compared them with the Copie above mentioned, we do again preſent them unto the Lords people, not with anie confidence that our pains hath put anie new lustre upon them; onlie we have ſome hopes that the whole ſubject being now before them, and theſe things in the way of expreſſion helped, which either might ſeem to be ſomewhat unpleaſant, or lyable to miſtakes, they ſhal not now be leſs edifying, nor leſs acceptable then formerlie they were. We did not think fit to make anie conſiderable alterations, as to the method, or other things of that kind, lest haplie by ſtraining his excellent purpoſes too much, to ſhape them to the ordinarie rules, or to reduce them to that order which might beſt have pleaſed our ſelves, vve ſhould have vvronged the matter it ſelf, at leaſt have put them to a loſs vvho did hear him preach, and it may be now upon their reading things in that ſame order as they heard them, vvill be the more readilie brought under the impreſſions of that livelineſs, power and vveights which (it may be) formerly they felt upon their heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvhen he vvas ſpeaking.</p>
            <p>If the method do not altogether ſatisfie ſome ſpir, rits, or the explication ſeem not ſo full; or if they firſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:178801:5"/> ſome introductions which poſſibly lead not in ſo cloſe, or ſeem not ſo ſutable to the ſubject of the Sermons; or haply now and then there be ſome little digreſſions from the main purpoſe, we ſhal deſire that this may not at all be conſtructed to be the Authors ignorance of rules and method, or his want of abilities in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane learning it being well known to thoſe who were beſt acquainted with him, that he had a ſcholastick ſpirit, and was in reading far beyond his age and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities for ſtudying; but as to all theſe, we ſhal intreat you rather to conſider: <hi>1.</hi> His age, and that his gift was but in the very moulding and breaking (as we ſpeak) in the point of order and method, when the Lord was pleaſed to call him home from his work. <hi>2. That every man hath his proper gift of God;</hi> who in his great wiſdom, and certainly for the good of the Church, doth ſo order, that there is ſomewhat ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and peculiar almoſt in every mans way, as to theſe things. <hi>3.</hi> For any thing we know, he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that high eſteem of this, or any other of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, as to deſign any of them for publick view, and theſe are but Notes taken from his mouth. <hi>4.</hi> We are perſwaded he ſtudied more his hearers then himſelf. Ye will eaſily perceive when ye have but read a little, that he hath been a man of a very zealous temper; that the great benfil of his ſpirit, and that which he did wholly ſpend himſelf about, was to make people know their dangerous condition by nature, and by all means to perſwade them to believe and lay hold upon the <hi>great ſalvation:</hi> And truly that a man in ſuch a frame ſhould leſs attend to theſe leſſer things, is not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:178801:5"/> to be wordered at.

                     </gap> diſcourſe upon that radical and precious grace of Faith, we intend to ſpeak of it under this twofold notion &amp; conſideration. Firſt, we ſhal ſpeak of it as it is <hi>juſtifying, or as it doth lay hold upon the righteouſneſs of a crucified Savior, making applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the precious promiſes in the Covenant of free grace, which we call juſtifying Faith.</hi> And in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, we ſhal ſpeak a little unto Faith, <hi>as it doth lay hold upon Chriſts ſtrength; for advancing the work of mortification; and doth diſcover the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal excellencies of Jeſus Chriſt by which we advance in the work of Holineſs and divine conformity with God, which we call ſanctifying Faith.</hi> However, it is not to be ſuppoſed that theſe are different habits of Faith, but different acts flowing from the ſame ſaving habit, laying hold and exerciſing themſelves upon Chriſt indifferent reſpects, and for diverſe ends. Now to ſpeak upon the firſt, we have made choiſe of theſe words. The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> in the former verſe had been pointing out the precious
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:178801:8"/> advantages of the grace of Obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; of keeping of his Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mands, that ſuch an one hath, as it were, an arbitrary power with God, &amp; doth receive many precious returns of prayer: As likewiſe, that one who is exerciſed in the grace of Repentance, is Gods delight; which is included in this, that he doth thoſe things that are well pleaſing in his ſight. And now in theſe words he doth, as it were, anſwer an objection that might be propoſed about the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of attaining theſe precious advantages, ſeeing his commands were ſo large, and that hardly could they be remembred. This he doth ſweetly anſwer, by ſetting down in this one verſe a ſhort compend or breviary both of Law &amp; Goſpel, <hi>viz. That we ſhould love one another,</hi> which is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend of the Law, <hi>and that we ſhould believe on the Name of his Son,</hi> which is the compend of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; &amp; by this he ſhoweth the Chriſtian that there are not many things required of him for attaining theſe excellent advantages; but if he exerciſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the obedience of theſe two comprehenſive commandments, he ſhall find favor both with God and man. And as concerning this precious grace of Faith, we have, 1. The advantages of it implyed in the words, &amp; clear alſo from the ſcope, as no doubt all the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mands have infinite advantages infolded in their boſom; which redou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds to a believer, by his practiſing of them. And 2. the excellency of it hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den forth in the words, in that it is called his <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi> as if he had no other command but this. And the Greek particle is here prefixed, which hath a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:178801:9"/> great deal of emphaſis and force in it, <hi>and this is his Commandment.</hi> But 3. there is this alſo, the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity of this grace, holden forth here in this word, <hi>his Commandment;</hi> as if he had ſaid by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of this command, I do ſet life and death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, and that you would not conceive that it is an arbitrary &amp; indifferent thing for you to believe or not; but be perſwaded of this, that as an infinite advantage may conſtrain you to the obedience of it, ſo abſolute neceſſity muſt perſwade you to act that which is of your everlaſting concernment. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ye have the precious object upon which Faith (which is juſtifying) doth exerciſe it ſelf, and that is upon the name of the Son of God: and no doubt faith is that excellent grace which doth elevate the ſoul unto a ſweet &amp; inſeparable union with Chriſt, and is that golden &amp; precious knot that doth eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally knit the hearts of theſe precious friends toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Faith is that grace that draweth the firſt draughts of Chriſts precious image on our hearts, &amp; by love doth accompliſh and perfect them. No, Faith taketh hold not only on the faithfulneſs of God, that he is a God of truth, &amp; that in him there is no lie: but likewiſe it taketh hold on the Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency of God, that he is one to whom nothing is too hard; and on the infinite mercy &amp; love of God, that he is one who doth delight to magnify this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute above all his works; and theſe are the three great pillars of juſtifying Faith. From the firſt, it anſwers all the objections of ſenſe, which doth or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily cry forth; <hi>Doth all his promiſe fail for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:178801:9"/>
                  <p>And that with his one word, <hi>If he hath once purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it, he will alſo do it;</hi> and if he hath once <hi>ſpoken it, he will alſo make it come to paſs.</hi> From the ſecond, it anſwereth all theſe objections that may ariſe from carnal reaſon, and probability, which tendeth to the weakning of his confidence. And theſe do oftentimes cry out; <hi>How can theſe things be?</hi> But Faith laying hold upon the Omnipotency of God, <hi>it ſtaggers not at the promiſe,</hi> but is ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g <hi>in the faith giving glory to God.</hi> And it is the noble and divine exerciſe of this heroick grace of Faith, that theſe objections of reaſon and probability, which it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not anſwer, it will lay them aſide, and yet cloſe with the promiſe; which was the practice of believing <hi>Abraham,</hi> who conſidereth not his own body being weak, nor the barrenneſs of <hi>Sarahs</hi> womb. As like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it was the commendable practiſe of that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. who not being able to anſwer the ſecond trial of her faith from reaſon; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, Faith made her cry out, <hi>Have mercy on me, O Son of David.</hi> And from the laſt, a Chriſtian doth anſwer all the arguments of misbelief, which doth ariſe from the convictions of our unworthineſs and ſinfulneſs; which makes us oftentimes imbrace that Divinity of <hi>Peters, Luke</hi> 5.8. <hi>Depart from me, for I am a ſinful man.</hi> But Faith taking hold on the infinite mercy and love of Chriſt, it anſwereth all with this: He walks not with us according to that rule of merit, but according to that precious and golden rule of love and boundleſs compaſſion.</p>
                  <p>But before we ſhal ſpeak any thing unto you of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:178801:10"/> theſe things, we would a little point out ſome few things to be known as previous to theſe; we ſhal not dwell long in pointing out the nature of juſtifying Faith: It is that grace whereby a Chriſtian being convinced of his loſt eſtate, &amp; of an utter impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to ſave himſelf, he doth flee to the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Jeſus Chriſt, and unto him who is that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious City of refuge, and there doth abide till our High Prieſt ſhal die, which ſhal not be for ever. Or if ye will, it is a ſweet travelling of the immortal ſoul betwixt infinite mercy, and infinite love; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt an utter impoſſibility to ſave our ſelves, and a compleat ability in him to <hi>ſave to the uttermost;</hi> betwixt abounding ſin, &amp; ſuperabounding mercy: hence Faith is often holden forth to us in Scripture under that notion of coming, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55.1. <hi>Ho, every one that thirſteth, come ye to the waters. Rev.</hi> 22.17. <hi>Whoſoever will, let him take the water of life freely.</hi> Heb. 7.25. <hi>Wherefore he is able alſo to ſave them to the uttermoſt that come to God by him.</hi> And we may ſay by the way, that if once a ſinner could be brought to this, to count all his own righteouſneſs but filthy rags, and to believe that a man is as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally juſtified before God by imputed righteouſneſs, as if it were by inherent holineſs; ſurely ſuch an one were not far from the Kingdom of God. Neither ſhal we ſtand long to point out this unto you, that it is your duty to believe; for it is clear, not only from this place, but likewiſe from <hi>Iſai</hi> 45.22. <hi>Look unto me, and be ye ſaved, all ye ends of the Earth,</hi> Matth. 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labor and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:178801:10"/> are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> John 14.1. <hi>Ye believe in God, believe alſo in me.</hi> Iſai. 55.1. <hi>Ho, every one that thirſteth, come ye to the waters; and he that hath no money, come, buy without money, and without price.</hi> But oh! it is a great miſery of many (and that which may be a ſubject of a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual lamentation) that we can neither be ſubject to the Law, as commanding to obey it, or as threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to believe it: Nor to the Goſpel, as promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to embrace it, and ſweetly to receive it. O but that primative temptation and deluſion whereby Satan did deceive our firſt father, is that whereby he yet ſeeks to catch and delude many ſouls, <hi>viz.</hi> That though we eat of the forbidden fruit, &amp; walk in the vain imaginations of our own hearts, yet he doth ſuggeſt this to us; that we ſhal not die, but ſhal once be as God; this is Satans great and deluding Divinity: And therefore to inforce this great and precious command a little further, we ſhal propoſe theſe conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that the Goſpel hath laid no obſtruction in our way of cloſing with Chriſt, and partaking of the effects of the Goſpel; but on the contrary, ſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth that the great impediment is our want of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs, which we lay in our own way, as is clear from <hi>John</hi> 5.40. <hi>Ye will not come to me that ye may get life;</hi> as likewiſe from Revel. 22.27. <hi>where the</hi> Gates of the Goſpel are caſt open, <hi>and whoſoever will,</hi> are commanded to enter in: So that although you may father your misbelief upon your inabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or that your ſpot is not the ſpot of his people, yet
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:178801:11"/> know that the riſe and original of it is want of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs. But to make this more clear, we would have you knowing this, that all the qualification annexed to this commandment of Faith, as that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 11.28. ſpeaketh out the qualifications ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe that will come, then of all theſe that ought to come: Or he inviteth theſe that through the Spirit of diſcouragement and misbelief, have the greateſt reluctancy to come; and may not that cardinal and ſoul-refreſhing promiſe, <hi>John</hi> 6.37. ſtop the mouth of misbelief, ſo that it ſhould have nothing to ſay? <hi>He that cometh unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt out;</hi> ye may reduce your misbelief ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the ſinfulneſs of your will, then to the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of your walk, and if once ye could come to the length of willingneſs to embrace Jeſus Chriſt, all other objections and knots ſhould be ſweetly looſed and diſſolved.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, conſider that though we ſhould pray the one half of our time, and weep the other, yet if we want this noble grace of Faith, the wrath of God ſhal abide on us. VVhat are all the works of theſe hypocrits, &amp; thoſe gliſtering acts of Law-ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, but a plunging of our ſelves in the ditch, Until our own cloaths abhor us? Therefore it is that after the Prophet <hi>Zachary</hi> hath made mention in the twelfth Chapter of this Propheſie, of making <hi>bitter lamentation for him whom we have pierced, as for an only Son,</hi> yet in the beginning of the 13. Chapter, he maketh mention of a <hi>Fountain opened to the houſe of</hi> David, <hi>for ſin and for uncleanneſs;</hi>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:178801:11"/> which may intimate unto us, that although we have waſhed our ſelves with our own tears, yet there is uſe of the blood of Chriſt, and that we muſt be waſhed in that fountain even from our <hi>own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſes, which are but as filthy rags.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, conſider that great and monſtrous ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs that is in this ſin of unbelief; we will ſtrain at a gnat, but many will eaſily ſwallow down this Camel: We will tithe mint and anniſe, and faſt twice in the week, but neglect faith and love, and judgement, which are the weighter things of the Law. And indeed there are theſe things which ſpeak out the ſinfulneſs of unbelief. 1. That when the holy Ghoſt is ſent to convince the world of ſin, <hi>John</hi> 16.9. he pitched upon this ſin, as though there were no other ſin of which the World had need to be convinced: <hi>He will convince the world of ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they believe not on the Son of God:</hi> &amp; no doubt there is more ſinfulneſs in that ſin, then in many breaches of the Moral Law, it being a ſin againſt matchleſs love, and againſt that which is the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of ſin. 2. That it is called by way of eminency, diſobedience, as is clear from <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Lest any of you fall under the ſame example of unbelief;</hi> or as the word may be tendred, <hi>leſt any of you fall after that example of diſobedience, Eph.</hi> 2.2.3. That amongſt all theſe that ſhal be eternally excommunicate from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power, thoſe that are guilty of this ſin of unbelief, they are put in the firſt place, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.1. And 4. That unbelief doth contradict &amp; deny theſe three
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:178801:12"/> precious and cardinal attributes of God. 1. Doth not unbelief contradict his faithfulneſs, and make him a liar? 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.10. 2. Doth it not contradict the infiniteneſs of his power? And 3. the infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his love, and ſuppoſeth that there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too hard for him which his power cannot reach, nor his infinite love overcome? We may reduce many of our queſtions and diſputings of his good will to this original, <hi>viz.</hi> to the diſputing of his power. No doubt, if we belong to him, we ſhal once ſing that note of lamentation over our unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; <hi>This is our infirmity, for changes are from the right hand of the moſt High.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And laſtly, to inforce this precious command of Faith, conſider that it is his command which ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth forth this, that we muſt not take an indulgence or diſpenſation to our ſelves to believe, or not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve at our pleaſure: and is it not a ſtrange thing that Chriſtians are leſs convinced of the breaches of the Commandment of Faith, then of other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands? They think misbelief to be but a <hi>Zoar,</hi> a little ſin; and it proceedeth either from this, that the convictions of other ſins (as the neglect of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or the ſin of ſwearing, or committing adultery) do ariſe from a natural conſcience; for there is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of natures light to make us abominate and hate them; when yet the light of nature will not lead us, to the convictions of the ſinfulneſs of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, it being a Goſpel &amp; more ſpiritual ſin. Or it proceedeth from this, that unbelief doth ordinarily paſs vail'd under the vizard of ſome refined vertue,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:178801:12"/> as humility and tenderneſs, though that rather it may be ſaid, that it is pride and ignorance, cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the garments of humility. And no doubt, Chriſt doth account obedience to this commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Faith, the greateſt act of humility, as is clear from <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. where it is called ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; they ſubmitted <hi>not to the righteouſneſs of God.</hi> Or elſe it proceedeth from this, that we conceive that the commandement of Faith is not of ſo large extent as other commands, and ſo doth not bind us to the obedience of it; but know this, that it ſhall be the condemnation of the world, that they have not believed on the Name of the Son of God; and no doubt but it is Satans great deſign and cardinal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, to keep us back from obedience to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of faith, &amp; that we ſhould not liſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the precious promiſes of this everlaſting Goſpel, but ſhould reject the counſel of God againſt our ſelves, and refuſe his precious and divine call.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond previous conſideration that we would give, ſhall be to ſhow you what are the cauſes that there is ſo much diſputing of our intereſt, &amp; ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle believing; that we are unſtable as water, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our own excellency, ſpending ſo much of our time in walking under a cloud, and are ſo ſeldome admitted to read our names in theſe precious and eternal records of Heaven. No doubt, theſe things have influence upon it, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That we are more judging of God by his diſpenſations, then by his Word, ſuppoſing ever the change of diſpenſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to ſpeak for the change of our ſtate; this is misbeliefs

We conceive, that if the eyes of our faith were opened, we might ſee infinite love engraven on the darkeſt acts, and moſt diſmal-like diſpenſations of his to us, though it be often-times written in dark and dim characters to ſenſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is this likewiſe which hath influence upon our ſo much diſputing and misbelieving, <hi>viz.</hi> a guilty conſcience, and the entertainment of ſome predominant luſt, which oftentimes occaſioneth our walking in darkneſs, and having no light, This is clear from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19. where that precious jewel of Faith can be holden in no other place but in a pute conſcience, that is that Royal place wherein it muſt dwel; and no doubt, if once we make <hi>ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack of a good conſcience,</hi> we will <hi>erre concerning our Faith.</hi> A boſom-Idol when it is entertained, doth exceedingly mar the vigorous exerciſes of theſe graces, which are evidences of our faith; and certainly Grace rather in its degrees, then in its ſincerity, or ſimple being only, is that which
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:178801:13"/> giveth the clear evidence of Faith. Therefore when we find not love in its high and eminent actings, we hardly win to make it any clearly-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding demonſtration of our Faith.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As likewiſe a boſom idol when it is entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, maketh us to loſe much of our high eſteem &amp; reputation of Jeſus Chriſt, which doth exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interrupt the ſweet and precious actings of faith. For it is certain, that if once the immortal ſoul be united to Jeſus Chriſt by the bond of love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, then our faith will increaſe with the increaſe of God, Our entertainment of a boſom idol is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily puniſhed with the want of the ſenſible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timations of his peace, and of our intereſt in him: ſo that ſometimes his own are conſtrained to cry out; <hi>God hath departed from me, and he anſwereth me not, neither by dreams nor viſions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is that likewiſe that hath influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, our not cloſing abſolutely with Jeſus Chriſt, but upon conditions and ſuppoſitions. We make not an abſolute and blank reſignation of our ſelves over to Chriſt, to hold faſt the Covenant, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he ſhould diſpenſe both bitter and ſad things to us? but we conceive that Chriſts Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with believers, is like that Covenant that God made with <hi>Noah,</hi> that there ſhould be Summer and Winter, ſeed time and harveſt, night and day unto a Chriſtian. A Chriſtian muſt have his night as well as his day: he muſt once ſow in tears, before he reap in joy: he muſt once go forth, bearing his precious ſeed, before he can return bearing his
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:178801:14"/> ſheaves in his boſom: and that this hath influence upon our inſtability, may be ſeen from this, that often a Chriſtian after his firſt cloſing with Chriſt, he meeteth with deſertion in point of tenderneſs, in point of joy, and in point of ſtrength, ſo that his corruption ſeems now to be awaked more then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, that he wants thoſe ſeeming enjoyments of him which formerly he had: and that much of his ſoftneſs of his heart hath now evaniſhed, which is clear ſomewhat from <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.32. <hi>And after they were enlightened, they endured a great fight of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> For the word that is there rendered afflictions, ſignifieth inward troubles through the motions of ſin, as well as outward afflictions, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.24. And God uſeth to diſpenſe this way to his own, not only to take tryal of the ſincerity of your cloſing with him, but to make our Faith more ſtedfaſt and ſure. And no doubt, if we cloſe not abſolutly with Chriſt (when under theſe temptations and tryals) we will reject our confidence as a deluſion, and ſuppoſe it to be but a morning dream: therefore it were a noble and divine practiſe of a Chriſtian, to cloſe with Chriſt without reſervation, ſeeing he doth diſpenſe nothing but that which might tend to our advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. And we would ſay to ſuch as are under theſe temptations, that if ye endeavor to reſiſt them, it is the moſt compendious and excellent way to make your hearts, which now are <hi>dying as a ſtone,</hi> to be as <hi>a watered garden, &amp; ſprings of water, whoſe waters fail not, and to make you ſtrong as a Lyon,</hi> ſo that no temptation can rouſe you up; but ye ſhall be
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:178801:14"/> enable to <hi>tread upon the high places of the earth,</hi> and to ſing ſongs of triumph over our idols.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. There is this likewiſe which hath influence on it, our building of our Faith more upon ſenſe then upon Chriſt or his word; and therefore it is that Faith is ſo unconſtant and changeable as the Moon, we not knowing what ſuch a thing means; <hi>To hope against hope, and to be strong in Faith, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving glory to God.</hi> And we would only ſay unto you that erect your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence upon ſo ſandy a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, that when the wind and ſtorm of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſhal blow, <hi>that houſe ſhal fall to the ground.</hi> As likewiſe, building of your Faith upon ſenſe, doth not abate much of your joy, and much of your precious eſteem of Jeſus Chriſt: It being Faith exerciſing it ſelf upon an inviſible object, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Chriſtian <hi>to rejoice with joy unſpeakable and full of glory,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. There is this laſt that hath influence upon it, even our ſloathfulneſs in the exerciſe of our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual duties, by which Faith ſhould be entertained. Faith is a tender grace, and a plant that muſt not be rufled, but nouriſhed through the ſap of other precious graces: but we grow remiſs in our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual duties, and do turn our ſelves upon the bed of ſecurity, as the door upon the hinges. And doth not our drowſineſs cloath us with rags, and make us fall into a deep ſleep, while as, if we were diligent, <hi>our ſouls ſhould be made fat and rich?</hi> Yea, ſloathfulneſs doth not only imped aſſurance of this, that it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth the divine communications of his love and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:178801:15"/> reſpect, by which aſſurance may be kept in life, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2. but alſo, <hi>it maketh our poverty come on us as an armed man, and our want as one that travelleth.</hi> And withal it letteth looſe the chain by which our corruptions are tyed, and maketh them to lift up their head, by which our aſſurance is much dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and impaired, and our hope is much converted into diffidence and deſpair. And we would only ſay this, it is the diligent Chriſtian that is the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Chriſtian; and it is the believing Chriſtian that is the diligent Chriſtian: there being ſuch a ſweet reciprocation betwixt theſe two precious graces, that they die and live together.</p>
                  <p>Now thirdly, we ſhal ſhut up our diſcours with this, in pointing out a little what are thoſe things that do obſtruct a Chriſtians cloſing with Chriſt, and believing in his precious Name.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. We conceive that this woful evil doth ſpring and riſe from that fundamental ignorance of this truth, that there is a God, as is clear from <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. where that is required as a qualification of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, <hi>That he ſhould believe that God is:</hi> and aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, till once this precious truth be imprinted upon our ſouls, <hi>as with a pen of iron, and point of a dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> we will look upon the Goſpel as an U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>opian fancy, and a deluding notion, to teach unſtable ſouls, who know not the way to attain unto real bleſſedneſs. And truly it is a fault of many, that they begin to diſpute their being in Chriſt, before they know there is a Chriſt; and do diſpute their intereſt in him before they believe his being, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:178801:15"/> that there is ſuch an one as is called Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Our coming unto Chriſt is obſtructed from the want of the real and ſpiritual convictions of our deſperate and loſt eſtate without Jeſus Chriſt, and that our unſpeakable miſery is the want of him: which is clear from <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.31. <hi>We are Lords, we will come no more to thee.</hi> And it is evident from <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.16.18. that ſuch a deluſion as this doth overtake many, that they can reign as Kings with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Jeſus Chriſt; and that they can build their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and eſtabliſh their carnal felicity upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther foundation: But, O that we could once win to this, to believe what we are without Chriſt, and to believe what we ſhal be in the enjoyment of him: with the one eye to deſcend and look upon theſe deep draughts, that the myſtery of iniquity hath imprinted upon our immortal ſouls; and withal, to reflect upon the wages of ſin, which is death, and be conſtrained to cry out, <hi>Wo is me, for I am undone:</hi> and with the other eye, to aſcend and look to that help that is <hi>laid upon one that is mighty,</hi> and to make uſe of the righteouſneſs of a crucified Savior, that ſo what we want in our ſelves, we may get it abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly made up in him.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. There is this likewiſe that obſtructeth our cloſing with Chriſt, our too much addictedneſs to the pleaſures and carnal delights of a paſſing world, which is clear from <hi>Luke</hi> 14.18.19.20.21.22 <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.5.6. where thoſe that are invited to come to the feaſt of this Goſpel, they do make their Apologie, and with one conſent do refuſe it, ſome pretending
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:178801:16"/> on impoſſibility to come, and ſome pretending a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> unavoidable inconveniency in coming. And, O! what a ridiculous thing is that poor complement that thoſe deluded ſinners uſed to Chriſt, <hi>I pray you, have us excuſed?</hi> And is not the world the great plea and argument that they make uſe of, when they will not come and make uſe of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. There is this laſtly, which doth obſtruct ones coming to Chriſt, their unwillingneſs to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to their own righteouſneſs, which is clear from <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.23. &amp; we conceive, if once theſe two were believed (which are the great Tropicks, out of which all theſe arguments may be brought, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you to imbrace Chriſt) to wit, the infinite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of his Perſon on whom we are to believe, &amp; the infinite loſs that thoſe do ſuſtain who ſhal be eternally rejected of him: we might be preſwaded to entertain a divine abſtractedneſs, &amp; holy retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from all things that are here below, and to pitch our deſires alone upon him, <hi>who is the everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting wonder of Angels, and the glory of the higher Houſe.</hi> O! did we once ſuppoſe the unſpeakable happineſs of thoſe whoſe Faith is now advanced unto everlaſting felicity &amp; fruition, and hath ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into that eternal poſſeſſion of the promiſes, might not we be conſtrained to cry out, <hi>It is good for us once to be there?</hi> Chriſt weepeth to us in the Law, but we do not lament; &amp; he pipeth unto us in the Goſpel, but we do not dance: he is willing to draw us <hi>with the cords of men, and with the bonds of love, and yet we will not have him to reign over us.</hi>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:178801:16"/> May not Angels laugh at our folly, that we ſhould ſo undervalue this Prince of love, and ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn him who is holden in ſo high eſteem &amp; reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in theſe two great aſſemblies that are above of Angels, and of the ſouls of juſt men made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect? Chriſt hath now given us the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſummons: the day is approaching when the ſad and woful ſummons ſhal be ſent againſt us, <hi>of departing from him into thoſe everlaſting flames,</hi> out of which there is no redemption: and this ſhal be the cap-ſtone of our miſery, that we had once life in our offer, but did refuſe it: And though there were four gates ſtanding open toward the North, by which we might have entered into that everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting reſt, yet we chooſed rather <hi>to walk in the paths that lead down to death, and take hold of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of hell.</hi> O! but there are many that think the Goſpel cunningly deviſed ſables and fooliſhneſs, (they being unwilling to believe that which ſenſe cannot comprehend, nor reaſon reach) and this is the ground why the Goſpel is not embraced, but is rejected as an humane invention, and as a morning dream, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>THere are three great and cardinal myſteries, in the unfolding of which, all a Chriſtians
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:178801:17"/> time ought to be ſpent. Firſt, there is that precious and everlaſting myſtery of Chriſts love and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcendency, which thoſe intellectual Spirits the Angels, are not able fully to comprehend. Secondly, there is that woful miſtery of the deſperate deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and wickedneſs of the heart, which no man was ever yet able to fathom and comprehend. And thirdly, there is that precious myſtery of that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal felicity and bleſſedneſs that is purchaſed unto the Saints, that once they ſhal reign with Chriſt, not a thouſand years only, but throughout all the ages of everlaſting &amp; endleſs eternity: ſo that there is this difference betwixt this garden of everlaſting delights, that Chriſt hath purchaſed to the Saints, and that firſt Paradiſe and <hi>Eden</hi> wherein man was placed. There was a ſecret gate in the firſt, thorow which a man that had once entered in, muſt go out again: But in the ſecond and precious <hi>Eden,</hi> there is no acceſs in going out; and all that is to be known of theſe three myſteries, is much comprehended in this, to know that they cannot fully be known. <hi>Paul</hi> was a bleſſed proficient in the ſtudy of the firſt my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, and had almoſt attained to the higheſt claſs of knowledge, and yet he is conſtrained to profeſs himſelf to be ignorant of this. Hence is that word, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.19. <hi>That ye may know the love of Christ which paſſeth knowledge.</hi> And is it not a myſterious command, to deſire people to know that which cannot be known? The meaning whereof we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be this in part, that <hi>Paul</hi> preſſed this upon them, that they ſhould ſtudy to know that this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:178801:17"/> of Chriſts love could not be known. <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> was a bleſſed proficient in the knowledge and ſtudy of the ſecond myſtery; he had ſome morning and twi-light diſcoveries of that; and yet though in ſome mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ure he had fathomed that deep, yet he is conſtrained to cry out, chap. 17. verſ 9. <hi>The heart is deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked, who can know it?</hi> And indeed that which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of Kings, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.3. may well be ſaid of all men, in this reſpect: <hi>The Heavens for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of man are unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> alſo was a bleſſed profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in the ſtudy of the third myſtery, having ſome morning and twi-light diſcoveries of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed reſt, and was once caught up to the third heavens, and yet when he is beginning to ſpeak of it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. he declareth all men to be ignorant of the knowledge of this profound myſtery of mans bleſſedneſs, and cryeth out; <hi>Eye hath not ſeen nor ear heard, neither have entred into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi> And if there be any thing further to be known in theſe myſteries, the grace of Faith is ſound wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy amongſt all the graces of the Spirit, <hi>to open the ſeven ſeals</hi> of the great depths of God. Is not the grace of Faith, that whereby a Chriſtian doth take up the inviſible excellency and vertue of a dying Chriſt? Is not Faith that precious grace by which a Chriſtian muſt take up the ſpots and blemiſhes that are within himſelf? And is not the grace of Faith, that precious grace that placeth a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:178801:18"/> Chriſtian upon the top of mount <hi>Piſga,</hi> and there letteth him ſee a ſight of the promiſed Land; and doth open a door in heaven, thorow which a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is admitted to ſee Chriſt ſitting upon his Throne? And faith hath not only a kind of Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency, as is clear, <hi>that all things are poſſible to them that believe;</hi> but it hath a kind of Omniſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and all knowledge, that it can take up and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all the greateſt myſteries of Heaven, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that word, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.5. <hi>He that ſeeketh the Lord ſhal underſtand all things:</hi> As if he had ſaid, there is nothing dark to a believing Chriſtian, as there is nothing impoſſible to a believing Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. As likewiſe Faith is that grace that muſt take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the vail that is ſpread over the face of a cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Chriſt: and Faith is that precious Spy that<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goeth forth, and taketh up theſe wonderful excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies that are in him. The grace of Love, as it were, is born blind, and it hath nothing wherewith to ſolace it ſelf, but that which is preſented unto it by this noble and excellent grace of Faith.</p>
                  <p>Now before we ſhal ſpeak any thing to theſe things that we did propoſe to ſpeak of at laſt occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we ſhal yet ſpeak a little unto ſome things which are neceſſary to be known for the diſtinct uptaking of the nature of juſtifying Faith, which is the great commandment of this everlaſting Goſpel; and that which we would firſt ſpeak to, ſhall be this: What is the reaſon and ground that the Goſpel conveyance of righteouſneſs and life (and of the excellent things of this everlaſting Covenant)
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:178801:18"/> ſhould be thorow the exerciſe of the grace of Faith; for it is not ſaid in the Scripture that Repentance juſtifieth, that Love juſtifieth, or that Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion juſtifieth; but it is Faith only that juſtifieth, and it is Faith by which a Chriſtian inheriteth the promiſes? So that is clear that Faith is that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit-pipe thorow which are conveyed to us the great bleſſings of this everlaſting Covenant.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. And the firſt ground of it is this, it is thorow <hi>Faith, that all our bleſsing may be known to be by love, and by free and unſearchable grace,</hi> as is clear, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. while the Apoſtle is giving a reaſon why the inheritance is conveyed to a Chriſtian through Faith: <hi>It is of Faith,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that it might be of grace;</hi> for if the inheritance were conveyed to a Chriſtian thorow a covenant of works then theſe ſpotleſſe draughts of infinite love, and of unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able grace, ſhould not be written on our inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as it is clear, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. And it is that g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">II. There is this ſecond ground likewiſe of it, that all the promiſes and bleſſings of this everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Covenant might be ſure and ſtedfaſt to us; therefore they are conveyed to us through the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the grace of Faith; as is clear, <hi>Rom</hi> 4.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There is this third ground why the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes &amp; excellent things of this Goſpel are conveyed to a Chriſtian through the exerciſe of Faith, that all boaſting and gloriation might be excluded, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that word, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. <hi>By what law is boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting excluded?

                  <p n="4">IV. There is this laſt ground, why the bleſſings of the Goſpel, and life and righteouſneſs are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to us through the exerciſe of Faith, that the way to attain to theſe things might be pleaſant and eaſie?

                     </gap>leaſant and difficult; but it is not an eaſie way <hi>of entring into the Holy of Holies,</hi> to win unto it through the exerciſe of Faith. <hi>Are not all wiſdoms wayes pleaſantneſs?

But, oh! that curſed ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial doth poſſeſs the breaſts of many, ſo that though that Crown of immortal glory and eternal bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be lying at your feet, yet ye will not imbrace it, nor take it up: Is not the hatred of many to Chriſt, covered with deceit? And therefore your <hi>iniquity ſhal be declared before the Congregation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now that what we have ſpoken upon this might be more clear, and that the nature of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Faith be not miſtaken, we would have you take notice of theſe things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the grace of Faith doth not juſtifie a Chriſtian as it is a work, or becauſe of any inherent
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:178801:20"/> excellency and dignity that is in this grace above any other graces of the Spirit; but faith doth alone juſtifie a Chriſtian, inſtrumentally and objective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; that is, it is that by which a Chriſtian is juſt, by laying hold on the precious object of it, the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt. And to clear this, we would only have you knowing this, that ſaith doth juſtifie as it cloſeth with Chriſt; but not becauſe it cloſes with Chriſt, which ſome vainly are bold to aſſert, becauſe there is not any dignity or worth in the act of Faith, incloſing with Chriſt, that can be the foundation of our juſtification; elſe it were to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found that precious degree of free grace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is this that we would have you all kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing that faith is not the inſtrument of juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as juſtification is taken in an active ſenſe) though it is the inſtrument of juſtification. as it is taken in a paſſive ſenſe; &amp; the ground of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is this, becauſe it is impoſſible that any actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in man can be an inſtrument of any action in God, and therefore that phraſe that you have ſo ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoken of, <hi>that faith juſtifieth,</hi> it is thus to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, <hi>that we are justified by faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is this that we would have you kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing, that betwixt a Chriſtians cloſſing by Faith with the righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt &amp; the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of a ſinner: I ſay, there is no natural &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſible connexion between theſe two; but only there is a connexion of divine appointment, &amp; of free grace; though we once conceive there is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ural aptitude in the grace of Faith to lay hold on
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:178801:20"/> the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, more then there is in any other grace of the Spirit, as ye may ſee there is a more natural aptitude and fitneſs in the hand to receive then in any other organ of the body.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is this alſo that we would have you knowing, that a Chriſtian in his firſt cloſing with Chriſt, Chriſt (conſidered as crucified) is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate object of his Faith, and not Chriſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in his perſonal excellencies. Hence it is often in Scripture, that Chriſt as crucified, is holden forth as the immediate object of juſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ying Faith; as is clear, <hi>Rom</hi> 3.5.24 25. And the ground of this aſſertion is this, becauſe that it is the formal object of juſtifying Faith which doth formerly juſtify the ſinners, and on which Faith doth immediatly lay hold, as a ranſome to ſatisfy Juſtice, and as a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in which the ſoul dare venture to be found, when it ſhall ſtand before the Judgement Seat of God: and certainly this is Chriſt, as obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the death of the croſs. And it is likewiſe clear, that the thing which doth engage the foul to Chriſt, is not only becauſe he is good in himſelf, but becauſe he is good to us.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And there is this laſtly, that we would have you knowing, that though Faith doth alone juſtifie yet Faith doth not juſtify being alone. Hence is that which we have often in Schools, <hi>Fides justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat ſolum; licet non ſolitariè;</hi> that Faith juſtifieth alone, though not being alone, as <hi>James</hi> doth ſpeak <hi>Faith without works is dead, and is of no effect.</hi>

                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:178801:23"/> be this, to point out to you ſome differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt juſtifying Faith which is in a real believer, and temporary Faith which is in an hypocrite, and one that is deſtitute of that everlaſting hope, though he do pretend to have it.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, that there is ſuch a thing as temporary Faith, as is clear from <hi>Luke</hi> 8.13. it is ſaid there of ſome, <hi>that they believed for a ſeaſon;</hi> yea, in <hi>Acts</hi> 1.13. it is ſaid of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> (who was in the gall of bitterneſs, and in the bond of iniquity) <hi>he belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> And thoſe in <hi>John</hi> 2.23. <hi>When they did behold the miracles, they believed on Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and yet we conceive that their Faith was not ſincere, and ſo this was not ſaving faith. And indeed ye may ſee a difference betwixt theſe two in the very name <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary;</hi> for this is ſuch a faith as doth not continue long with him that hath it, but doth evaniſh and paſs away: for as this is certain, <hi>that an hypocrite will not alwayes call upon God, Job</hi> 27.10. ſo that is alſo certain, that an hypocrite will not always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in God. I tell you, that the longeſt time an hypocrite doth keep his faith, <hi>Job</hi> hath ſet down in his 18. chapter, verſ. 14. <hi>Their hope,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall bring them to the King of terrors, and then it ſhall be rooted out of them and their tabernacle;</hi> their faith will bring them no further then the gates of death, and then their faith will flee away as a dream, and evaniſh as a viſion of the night.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. There is this difference likewiſe betwixt them, that temporary faith it cloſeth with Chriſt as a Savior, and for righteouſneſs; but it cloſeth not
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:178801:23"/> with Chriſt as a Prince, and for ſanctification: but juſtifying faith taketh Chriſt as well for a Prince, as it taketh him for a Savior: and if <hi>Solomon</hi> did diſcern who was the true mother of the child, by that that ſhe who would have had the child divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, was not the mother of the child; ſo we may ſay, that they who would divide Chriſt in his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, it is an evidence that they are not amongſt thoſe who are actually made partakers of the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of children: there is ſome what of this pointed at in <hi>John</hi> 6.66. where that which made many who were his Diſciples (and did once believe) deſert him, was becauſe of the hardneſs of his command. <hi>This is an hard ſaying, who can hear it?</hi> And it is certain that it is a greater difficulty for a Chriſtian to take Chriſt as a Prince, then as a Savior, for by that he muſt make an abſolute reſignation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf over to Chriſt, never to be reduced. O! when ſaw you ſuch a ſight of Chriſt, that ye were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to cry out (without a complement) to him: <hi>Truly, I am thy ſervant, I am thy ſervant.</hi> O! were ye never raviſhed <hi>with one of his eyes,</hi> nor overtaken <hi>with one chain of his neck?</hi> Believe me, they who ſee him thus, do believe that <hi>his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands are grievous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III. There is this difference, that temporary faith is attained unto without the exerciſe of the Law; but juſtifying faith is not attained to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome meaſure of the exerciſe of the Law: this is clear, <hi>Mark</hi> 4.5. where ſpeaking of theſe tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary believers, it is ſaid of them, <hi>That the fruit did
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:178801:24"/> imediately ſpring up,</hi> &amp;c. Are there not ſome (i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> may be here) who think they do believe, and yet were never in any meaſure trembling under the diſcovering &amp; condemning power of the Law? Is not that a myſtery, that one ſhould b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing forth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out travelling? And is not this a myſtery in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, that one ſhould believe before he hath found the pangs of the New birth? I am afraid of this, that many of us have taken up our Religion at our foot; for there are many who take up Religion, before Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> take them up. But would you know the properties of a Chriſtians Faith? <hi>It is a begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten faith,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. and not a Faith that is taken up at our pleaſure. And I would only ſay theſe two things to you, be perſwaded of this, that hypocriſie may be ſoon with a very ſmal threed, ſo that the moſt diſcerning Chriſtian cannot take up that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate enmity that is in them. How long did <hi>Judas</hi> lurk under the name of a Saint, even with thoſe that were moſt diſcerning? And there is this that we would ſay, that amongſt all theſe <hi>that ſhal be eternally exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power,</hi> hypocrites in <hi>Zion</hi> ſhal have the bittereſt cup of divine indignation preſented unto them. Hence it is that Chriſt when he would tell the worſt company that one ſhal have in hell, it is alwayes this, ye ſhal go to that place where hypocrites and ſinners are; and ſo it would be of your concernment, that by the candle of the Lord ye would <hi>ſearch the inward part of the belly, before ye go down to the grave with a lie in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:178801:24"/> your right hand, a deceiving heart having turned you aſide.</hi> We confeſs, it is ſad to conſider thoſe anxious diſappointments that many in theſe days ſhal once meet with.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. But there is this laſt difference betwixt ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying Faith and temporary Faith, that there are three precious effects of juſtifying Faith, which a temporary believer cannot win to.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To be denyed to all his enjoyments and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, and to walk humbly under them; for we may ſay that it is impoſſible for an hypocrite to be denyed to his enjoyments, he maketh ſuch a Deity of them, and worſhips them, or rather he worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth himſelf in them. There are three great Graces that an hypocrite doth purſue after (though he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeeketh them as gifts, then as Graces) know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, prayer, and humility: And though it be but little, he can attain of any of the three, (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nothing, in a ſaving way) yet leaſt of all can he attain to the laſt; yea, we may judge that there is always within his boſom a ſtanding conviction, that he could never win unto that gracious Grace of Humility. O! could ye never win to this, to count your own righteouſneſs as filthy rags, and to rejoyce alone in the righteouſneſs of a crucified Savior? I would preſs this upon you by the way (O Chriſtians of this generation) forget your perfections, and remember your imperfections: have an holy oblivion of your attainments, but have a divine remembrance of your ſhort-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings: look more to what is before unperfected,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:178801:25"/> then to what is behind, and thus ſhal you evidence true juſtifying Faith.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is an effect of juſtifying Faith, to be under ſome conſtant and divine impreſſion of the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, according to that word, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 27. <hi>To you who believe, Chriſt is precious.</hi> It is not ſaid, that Chriſt was precious, or ſhal be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; but it is ſaid, <hi>he is precious,</hi> which doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port (as we uſe to ſpeak) a continued act. Did ye never know what it was to dwell twenty four hours under the impreſſion of the matchleſs excellency, and precious worth of a crucified Savior? I will poſe you with this; Are there not ſome here (and elſe where) that paſs under the notion of Saints, that never knew what it was to dwell half an hour under theſe high and elevating thoughts of the preciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Jeſus Chriſt? So that we profeſs we cannot tell whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>er we ſhal call him precious or underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued; but we may conjoin theſe two together, that he is a precious, and yet undervalued Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By juſtifying Faith, a Chriſtian winneth to mortification of his inviſible &amp; predominant luſts, which is impoſſible for a temporary believer to win to. And is there not a great difference betwixt an Idol when it is caſt out, and an Idol when it but goeth out? I will tell you the great mortification of hypocrites, the devil was living in them as one that was a black one, and now he cometh again and transformeth himſelf into an Angel of light. He was living in them before by his ſpirit of propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and now he liveth in them by the ſpirit of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:178801:25"/> hypocriſy, and counterfeiting of thoſe things that were never clear attainments, while it is the noble dignity of Faith, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.9. <hi>to purifie the heart:</hi> but are there not many here who never knew what it was to mortify one luſt for Chriſt? Can ſuch a deluſion overtake you, O Atheiſts! that ye ſhall reign with Chriſt, if ye die not with him? There is an opinion vented in theſe dayes, that there may be repentance in heaven; &amp; I think it would ſeem that the Chriſtians of this age have much of that opinion, we are ſo little in repentance while we are here below: but know that Faith and Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are two inſeparable companions: And let me tell you, if you will know the compend of the precious exerciſe of Faith, it is this: Faith hath three great things that it perpetually contemplates and views. 1. Faith looketh to the promiſe, and there it doth rejoyce and reſt upon it. 2. Faith looketh to the duties that are commanded, and there it cryeth out: <hi>Here am I, I will obey and hearken unto the voyce of the Word.</hi> And 3. Faith looketh to the crown, and there it doth exult and ſweetly rejoyce in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine expectation. And O what a ſight is that, to behold that everlaſting Prince ſtanding at the end of our race, having a crown in his right hand, with this Motto engraven on it, <hi>He that perſevereth to the end, ſhal be ſaved!</hi> And what a Faith, ſuppoſe ye, it ſhall be thought, when we ſhall get on that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal crown of bleſſedneſs? What think ye is the exerciſe of thoſe that are above? O Heaven! Heaven! if we did know it! would we not be in
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:178801:26"/> an holy extaſie of deſire, till we were there? And bleſſed be he eternally, that hath purchaſed that precious felicitie to us.</p>
                  <p>Now we ſhal at this time ſhut up our diſcourſe, by ſpeaking a little to thoſe things in which a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth ordinarily meet with aſſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of this inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in God, and is put to the divine actings of the Grace of Faith; for there are ſome ſealing times to a Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. The firſt time of the ſealing is, after the morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of ſome predominat luſt and Idol; then they are admitted to read their names in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and ancient records of Heaven, and to ſee in theſe books their unworthy names written by the hand of that everlaſting Prince. This is clear <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.17. <hi>To him that overcometh wil I give a white ſtone, and in the ſtone a new name written, that no man knows ſaving he that receiveth it.</hi> And from that 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. Believe me more mortification would make more believing; but would ye know the original of misbelief? It is the want of exerciſe of ſpiritual mortification of our luſts. I know not where the moſt part of us intendeth to lodge at night, but this is certain, that we live with much contentment with our luſts, and theſe predominat Idols that do ſo much poſſeſſe us.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. It is ſecondly, a ſealing time to a Chriſtian; when he is admitted to the divine enjoyment of theſe ſatisfying delights that are to be found in Chriſt: When was it that the Spouſe cryed out ſo often, <hi>My beloved is mine, and I am his?</hi> Was it
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:178801:26"/> not when ſhe <hi>was brought to the banquetting and his banner over her was love?</hi> Believe me, more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with an abſent Chriſt would make more intimation (in a divine manner) of our peace with him. We deſire to bleſs thoſe that are above the reach of all theſe diſputings and queſtions that we are ſo much ſubject unto.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. This is a ſealing time to a Chriſtian, when he is much in the exerciſe of ſecret Prayer, and of much converſing, and correſponding with God in that duty, as is clear in that word from <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.21. When <hi>Daniel</hi> was praying at the evening oblation, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n the 23 verſe, he meets with a divine intimation of his peace with God; <hi>O man, greatly beloved of God,</hi> as the Original hath it, <hi>O man of great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires;</hi> for he was deſireable indeed, and precious to him who holdeth the Saints in his right hand.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. This is alſo a fealing time to a Chriſtian, when he is called to the exerciſe of ſome great work, and is to be put upon ſome eminent holy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment; this is clear, <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.5. where <hi>Jeremiah</hi> being called to preach the Goſpel unto ſuch a rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious people, then he hath his eternal election de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared unto him: <hi>Before thou waſt formed in the womb, I knew thee.</hi> Chriſt, as it were, giveth them that, to be meat to them for fourty dayes, and that in the ſtrength of it, they may go many a days journey.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. There is alſo another ſealing time, when a Chriſtian is firſt begotten to a precious and everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting hope; for when at firſt Chriſtians begin to be
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:178801:27"/> acquainted with Chriſt, even then ſometimes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>IT was a command that <hi>Solomon</hi> gave unto his ſon, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.26. <hi>That he ſhould not be ſurety for debt, nor be one of thoſe that ſtriketh hands.</hi> But, O! what ſpotleſs breaches of that command hath our bleſſed Lord Jeſus committed, when he did condeſcend to be ſurety for our debt, and to pay that which was impoſſible for us to ſatisfy? Hath not Chriſt made a precious exchange with ſinners? He wreathed about his own precious neck, that bond and yoke of our iniquities, and hath given to us that unweariable, eaſie and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table yoke of his commandments, amongſt which this is one, <hi>That we ſhould believe on him:</hi> ſpotleſs <hi>Chriſt was made ſin for us;</hi> that ſinful, <hi>we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi> And is not this the condemnation of the World, <hi>that we will not believe on him?</hi> That we will not delight our ſelves in loving of him? And I would ſay this to you, that though ye ſhould weep the one half of your dayes, and pray the other half, yet if ye want this noble grace of Faith, <hi>your righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall be but like a monſtruous cloath, and filthy rags before him.</hi> For what is praying without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, but a taking of his bleſſed Name in vain? What is our conferring upon the moſt divine and precious truths of God without believing?
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:178801:29"/> it is not a lying to the Holy Ghoſt, and a flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of God with our mouth? And we would have you knowing this, that there is a ſweet harmony that is now made up betwixt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Law and the Goſpel. The Law brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth us to Chriſt as a Savior, and Chriſt bringeth us back again to the Law, to be a rule of our walk, to which we muſt ſubject our ſelves. So then, would ye know the compend of a Chriſtians walk? <hi>It is a ſweet travelling betwixt Mount Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai, and Mount Sion, betwixt Moſes and Chriſt, betwixt the Law and the Gospel.</hi> And we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that the more deep that the exerciſe of the Law be in a Chriſtians conſcience, before his cloſing with Chriſt, there is ſo much the more precious and excellent advantages waiting for him.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. There is this advantage that waiteth on the deep exerciſe of the Law, that it is the way to win to much eſtabliſhment in Faith, when once we begin to cloſe with Chriſt. O Chriſtians! would ye know that which maketh the ſuperſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture and building of grace to be within you, as <hi>a bowing wall, and as a tottering ſence?</hi> (of that oftentimes ye are in hazard to raze the foundation) it is this, ye were not under the exerciſe of the Law before your believing in Jeſus Chriſt. There are ſome who do not abide three days at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and theſe ſhall not dwell many days at Mount <hi>Sion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. There is this advantage that waiteth on the deep exerciſe of the Law, it maketh Chriſt
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:178801:29"/> precious to a mans ſoul. What is that which fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the ſoul of a Chriſtian with many high and excellent thoughts of Chriſt? Is it not this, to have the Law regiſtrating our Bond, and putting us (as we uſe to ſpeak) to the Horn? That is, to have the Law curſing us, and uſing the ſentence of condemnation againſt us. That which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth us have ſuch low and undervaluing thoughts of precious Chriſt, is, becauſe the moſt part of us are not acquainted with the deep and ſerious exerciſe of the Law; that is a myſtery to the moſt part of a Chriſtians practiſe. Ye know that there were four ſtreams which went out from the Paradiſe of God, into which man was firſt placed; and ſo may we ſay, that there are four gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſtreams, by which loſt and deſtroyed, man is brought back again to this <hi>Eden</hi> and Paradiſe of everlaſting delights. Firſt, there is the precious ſtream of Chriſts righteouſneſs, by which we muſt be juſtified. And ſecondly, there is that ſtream of his Sanctification, by which we muſt be purified. Thirdly, there is that ſtream of the wiſdom of Chriſt, by which we muſt be conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through this wilderneſs wherein we have loſt our way. And fourthly, there is that ſtream of Chriſts Redemption, by which we muſt be delivered from the power of our enemies; and muſt turn the battel in the gate, it is by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Chriſt, that we ſhall once ſing that triumphant ſong: <hi>O Death! where is thy ſting? O Grave! where is thy victory?</hi> O, but all theſe ſtreams will be ſweet and refreſhing to a ſoul
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:178801:30"/> that is hotly purſued by the Law; So long as we ſee not the uglineſs of our leproſie in that glaſs of the Law, we have our own <hi>Abana</hi> and <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,</hi> that we think may do our turn; but when once our caſe is truly laid open to us, then will we be content to waſh our ſelves in <hi>Jordan</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. There is this advantage that waiteth on the deep exerciſe of the Law, that it maketh a Chriſtian live conſtantly under the impreſſion of the ſinfulneſs of ſin. What is it that maketh ſin exceeding ſinful to a Chriſtian? Is it not this, he hath been fourty dayes in <hi>Moſes</hi> School? And we conceive that the ground why ſuch fools as we make a mock of ſin, is, becauſe we know not what it is to be under the power of his wrath, and the apprehenſions of the indignation of God.</p>
                  <p>But now to come to that which we intend to ſpeak of, we told you at the firſt occaſion that we ſpake upon theſe words, that there were many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things concerning the grace of Faith hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den forth in them: The firſt thing which was holden forth concerning this radical grace of Faith, was the infinite advantage that redoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to a Chriſtian through the exerciſe of Faith, and giving obedience to this command; which we cleared, to be holden forth not only from the ſcope, but alſo from the nature of this command. And now to ſpeak a little to the point, we ſhall propoſe theſe coſiderations that may abundantly ſhow how advantagious a thing this excellent grace of Faith is.</p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:178801:30"/>
                  <p n="1">I. The firſt conſideration that ſpeaketh it, is this, that Faith maketh Chriſt precious to a ſoul, according to that word, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. <hi>To you that believe, Chriſt is precious.</hi> And we would have you knowing this, that Faith maketh Chriſt more precious to a ſoul, then ſenſe, or any other thing can make him. And firſt, Faith maketh Chriſt more precious then ſenſe, becauſe the eſtimation which the grace of Faith hath of Chriſt, it is builded upon the excellency of his Perſon; but the eſtimation of ſenſe, it is builded upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of his actings; ſo that becauſe he is ſuch to them, therefore they love and eſteem him: But that heroick grace of Faith, it taketh up the excellency of Chriſts perſon, and that maketh him precious to them. Secondly, Faith makes Chriſt more precious then ſenſe, becauſe ſenſe looketh to that love which Chriſt manifeſteth in his face, and in his hands, and in his feet: But Faith looketh to that love which is in his heart. Sence will cry forth: <hi>Who is like to thee, whoſe countinance is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedar; whoſe hands are as gold rings ſet with beril, and whoſe legs are like pillars of marble, ſet in ſockets of gold?</hi> Senſe will look to the ſmilings of Chriſt, and will wonder; it will look to his diſpenſations and actings, and will be conſtrained to cry out, <hi>Who is like unto thee?</hi> But the grace of Faith ſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth it ſelf in the fountain from whence all theſe ſprings and ſweet inundations of love do flow. Thirdly, Faith maketh Chriſt more precious then ſenſe; becauſe Faith looketh not only to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:178801:31"/> what Chriſt is preſently, but unto what Chriſt is from eternity before time, and what Chriſt ſhall be unto eternity after time; but ſenſe only doth look to what Chriſt is preſently. And ye muſt conceive that the ſweet travelling of Faith betwixt infinite love from eternity before, and infinite love unto eternity after; muſt make Faith to fall in a ſea of wondering, &amp; raiſeth the thoughts to the higheſt pitch of deſire and eſtimation. Fourthly, we may likewiſe add, that the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the preciouſneſs of Chriſt, which ſenſe maketh upon the ſoul, is not ſo conſtant, nor ſo ſingle, as that which Faith doth make. O, but the grace of Faith giveth the Chriſtian a broad look of Chriſt, and letteth him ſee Chriſt cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ornaments of glory and divine Majeſty. Senſe followeth Chriſt, rather that it may ſee his miracles and love, that it may be fed with loaves; but Faith follows Chriſt, for himſelf, above all.</p>

The ſecond conſideration, to ſpeak the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of it, is, that the grace of Faith, it hath, as it were, an arbitrary power with God; ſo that <hi>whatſoever a Christian ſhall ſeek in Faith, he ſhall receive it.</hi> It was the noble gift that was once gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Faith, that it never ſhould ſeek any thing and be denied, according to that word in <hi>Matt.</hi> 21.22. <hi>And all things whatſoever ye ſhall ask in prayer believing, ye ſhall receive it.</hi> And that word in <hi>John</hi> 15.7. <hi>Abide in me,</hi> that is, believe; and the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> is annexed to this: <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall ask ye ſhall receive.</hi> And it is clear likewiſe from the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:178801:31"/> preceeding verſe to our Text, that if we obey this command of Faith, <hi>Whatſoever we ſhal ask of God, we ſhal receive it.</hi> And I would ſpeak theſe two things to you from this. Firſt, that oftentimes Chriſt putteth a blank in a Chriſtians hand, who is much in the exerciſe of Faith, according to that in <hi>Matth</hi> 20.32. Is there not an ample blank put into that mans hand? <hi>What wilt thou that I ſhould do unto thee?</hi> Chriſt deſireth him to fill up the blank with what he would. And ſecondly, there is this, which is one of the greateſt ſteps of Chriſts matchleſs condeſcendency, that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when his own have ſought in their preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption a blank to be put in their hand, Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcendeth to give it, according to that ſtrange paſſage in <hi>Mark</hi> 10.35.36. the two Diſciples who preſent this deſire to Chriſt, We deſire, ſay they, <hi>that whatſoever we ask, thou ſhouldeſt give it unto us.</hi> And preſently that is anſwered: <hi>What will ye that I ſhal do for you?</hi> Chriſt hath an infinit good will to ſatisfie the deſires of his own: and that which yet more ſpeaketh out Chriſts boundleſs good will to ſatisfie the deſires of all that belong to him, it may be decared in that word, <hi>John</hi> 16.24. where he chargeth his Diſciples with this: <hi>Hither to,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>have ye asked me nothing:</hi> ye muſt not ſuppoſe that <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> never ſought a ſuite of Chriſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; but the meaning of that expreſſion is this: Ye ſought nothing in compariſon of that which I was willing to give, and which your neceſſity did call for at my hands, which ye ſhould have ſought.</p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:178801:32"/>
                  <p n="3">III. There is this third conſideration, to poin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> out the advantage of Faith: it is that grace tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> which, all the lower wheels do move: if ſo we may ſpeak, Faith is that <hi>Primum mobile,</hi> that firſt moves and turns about all theſe lower graces of the Spirit, according to that, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Add to your faith, vertue, and to your vertue, patience, and to your patience, brotherly kindneſs.</hi> Firſt, the grace of Faith keepeth in exrciſe the grace of love, as is clear, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17. where theſe two gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are conjoined. As likewiſe from <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. compared with <hi>verſe</hi> 5. <hi>Being juſtified by faith.</hi> Then this leffect followeth upon it, <hi>the love of God is ſhed abroad in our hearts.</hi> And ſo it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that Faith keepeth love in life. Faith being the ſpy of the ſoul, and that intelligencer and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious meſſenger: it goeth out and bringeth in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects unto love. Faith draweth and bringeth in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects unto love. Faith draweth aſide the vail, and love ſitteth down and ſolaceth it ſelf in the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of Faith. Secondly, the grace of Faith likewiſe it keepeth the grace of mortification in exerciſe, as is clear, not only from <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.9. but from 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.4. <hi>This is our victory whereby we overcome the world, even our faith.</hi> And it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that Faith keepeth mortification in exerciſe, and advanceth holineſs, not only becauſe of this, that Faith is that grace that preſenteth to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian the abſolute purity and ſpotleſs holineſs of Jeſus Chriſt; but alſo becauſe it maketh them eſteem their idols taſte leſs as the white of an egg,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:178801:32"/> and they become unto them as their ſorrowful meat. The beſt principle of mortification is this, the diſcoveries of the inviſible vertues of Jeſus Chriſt: that mortification which ariſeth from the lovely diſcoveries of the excellency of Jeſus Chriſt, is moſt real and abiding; as thoſe waters which riſe from the higheſt ſprings, are not only conſtant, but likewiſe moſt deep and excellent. Thirdly, Faith likewiſe hath influence upon mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification as it doth take hold of that infinite ſtrength that is in Chriſt, by which a Chriſtian is inabled to mortifie his coruptions. Fourthly, Faith likewiſe maketh application <hi>of the blood of ſprinkling,</hi> by which we are purified from dead works. Fifthly, likewiſe the grace of Faith kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth in exerciſe the grace of Humility, as is clear, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. <hi>By what law,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is boaſting ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded? It is not by the law of works, but by the law of faith.</hi> Sixthly, Faith keepeth in exerciſe the grace of joy, as is clear, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13. <hi>Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> So that ye ſee the proper fruit of Faith, is <hi>joy in the holy Ghoſt.</hi> And certainly, did we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve more, we ſhould rejoice more. Seventhly, and laſtly, Faith keepeth in exerciſe the grace of Hope, for it is impoſſible for hope to be in lively exerciſes, except Faith once be exerciſed, which may be a ſhame unto you; for how can we hope to attain the thing that is promiſed, except our Faith firſt cloſe with the promiſe? So there is this difference betwixt the grace of Faith, and the grace of Hope? the grace of Faith cloſeth with
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:178801:33"/> the promiſes; but the grace of Hope, it cloſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="4">IV. There is this fourth conſideration, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> may ſpeak out the excellency of the grace <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

I will tell you what Faith is, it is a ladder that reacheth betwixt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, by the ſteps of which, a Chriſtian doth dayly go up to heaven, and converſe with the higher Houſe. Faith is that grace, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>by which we have acceſs to the Throne of his grace.</hi> Faith uſhers in the believer to the Throne; and without it, he can have no acceſs there, nor joy when he is there.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. Here is this advantage that attendeth the exerciſe of Faith, a believing Chriſtian is a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtian according to that word in <hi>Mark</hi> 9.24. where theſe two are conjoined together <hi>Lord, I believe;</hi> and then he falleth to his prayer preſently, after that confeſſion, <hi>Help thou our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief.</hi> And it is clear from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.1. <hi>O God thou art my God, early will I ſeek thee: my ſoul
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:178801:33"/> Chriſteth for thee.</hi> And ſometimes Faith is a moſt impatient grace; but we may alwayes ſay of it that it is a moſt diligent grace. Oh! is not the neglect of this precious exerciſe of Faith, and of the duty of ſecret prayer, that makes our lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>neſs teſtifie to our face, and maketh our ſouls as a barren wilderneſs? I am perſwaded of this, that ſinc0e Ch iſt had any followers, and ſince ever this everlaſting Goſpel was preached in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, the exerciſe of ſecret prayer was never ſo much neglected; we have turned over all our prayers into complements with God. We know not what it is <hi>to riſe at mid-night, and call upon God, and to enquire after our Maker under the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent watches of the night.</hi> O, but it is a ſweet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion from ſleep, to retire our ſelves, in the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſeaſons of the night, from all thoughts about worldly matters, and to converſe with that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Majeſty.</p>
                  <p n="6">IV. There is this ſixth conſideration, to point out the advantage of Faith, that Faith is that grace that doth facilitate a Chriſtians obedience, and maketh it moſt pleaſant and eaſie: this is clear from <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.8, <hi>By faith Abraham when he was commanded to go to a ſtrange land, obeyed, and went out, not knowing whether he went.</hi> The word may be rendered, <hi>he did chearfully obey.</hi> And verſ. 17. <hi>By faith he offered up his only ſon.</hi> Would ye know the reaſon why his commands are your burden? And why his preceps are your creſſes? It is becauſe of this <hi>ye do not believe.</hi> And ſo it is moſt certain, that it is impoſſible for a Chriſtian
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:178801:34"/> to attain to a pleaſant way of obedience without the exerciſe of faith. Faith holdeth up the crown to a Chriſtian, and this crown maketh him to obey. Faith gathereth ſtrength from Chriſt, and that ſtrength maketh obedience very eaſie. Faith taketh up the excellency of Chriſt, and this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a Chriſtian to look upon his duty, more as his dignity, then his duty. And we are perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of this, that our chariot-wheel ſhould move more ſwiftly <hi>(like the chariots of Aminadab)</hi> if we were more in the exerciſe of the grace of Faith. Would ye know an anſwer to that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, what is firſt more requiſite for a Chriſtian while here below? Faith. And what ſecondly, is moſt requiſite? Faith. And what thirdly, is moſt requiſite for a Chriſtian? Even Faith. Faith above all things, and above all things, Faith.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. There is another advantage of it, that by Faith our ſervices and prayers are accepted of God. Would ye know what is the prayer of a Chriſtian that is not in Faith? <hi>It is a ſmoak in his noſtrils, and a fire that burneth all the day. The unbelivers ſacrifice is an abomination to the Lord.</hi> This is clear from <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.4. <hi>By faith Abel offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up unto God a more acceptable ſacrifice then Cain.</hi> And we conceive, that there are many unanſwered prayers which we do put up, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we want that noble exerciſe of Faith.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. And laſtly, we ſhal likewiſe add this, that faith is the grace by which a Chriſtian hath that pefect and immediate ſight, as is were, of great things that are promiſed to him. Faith
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:178801:34"/> bringeth a Chriſtian within ſight of Heaven, and Faith bringeth a Chriſtian within ſight of God, according to that word, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. <hi>Faith is the evidence of things not ſeen.</hi> And that noble Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox that is ſaid of Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.27. <hi>By faith Moſes ſaw him that is inviſible.</hi> Is it not an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible thing to ſee that which cannot be ſeen? But the meaning of it is this, that Faiths diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of God are as certain and ſure as the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our bodily eyes are. Faith is an intelligent grace, yea, it is a moſt ſure and infallible grace. What will Faith not do? And what can you do who want Faith?</p>
                  <p>Now to enforce the advantages and excellencies of Faith a little more, we ſhal propoſe to you the diſadvantages of that woful ſin of unbelief.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is this diſadvantage of the ſin of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, that all the actions that proceed from an unbeliever, they are impure and defiled, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that in <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. <hi>But unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure, but even their mind and conſcience is defiled, their prayer is unclean;</hi> yea, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>their plowing in ſin;</hi> yea, their going about the moſt excellent duties (for matter) is an abomination to God, according to that word, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.23. <hi>What ever is not of faith, is ſin.</hi> So the want of Faith is the great polluter of all our actions, and of all our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is this ſecond diſadvantage of misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that it is impoſſible for one in the exerciſe of unbelief, to mortifie a luſt or idol; and we may
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:178801:35"/> allude unto thoſe words in <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.20. when his Diſciples came to him, &amp; asked him this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>Why could not we caſt out this devil?</hi> Tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> was given as an anſwer, <hi>Becauſe of your unbelief.</hi> Unbelief is that which taketh up arms for out idols, and doth moſt ſtrongly defend them; for there is nothing that will kill corruption ſo much as the exerciſe of Faith: and when that is laid aſide, we have laid by our weapons, and have in a manner, concluded a treaty of peace with our idols that we ſhal not offend them, if they do not offend us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is this diſadvantage that waiteth upon the ſin of unbelief, that ſuch an one cannot win to attain to the grace of eſtabliſhment, <hi>but is alwayes as the waves of the ſea toſſed to and fro,</hi> until once he win to the exerciſe of Faith, as is clear from <hi>Iſai.</hi> 7.9. <hi>Except ye believe, ye ſhal not be establiſhed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is this diſadvantage that waiteth on it, is the mother of hardneſs and ſtupidity of heart, according to that word in <hi>Mark</hi> 16.14, where he upbraideth them becauſe of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief; and then that danger followeth, to with <hi>hardneſs of heart,</hi> this is clear alſo from <hi>Acts</hi> 19 9. where theſe two ſiſter-devils are conjoined and locked together, <hi>unbelief and hardneſs of heart;</hi> becauſe it is unblief indeed that hindereth all the graces, by which the grace of Tenderneſs muſt be maintained.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. There is this diſadvantage in the ſin of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, that it is big with child of apoſtaſie from
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:178801:35"/> God, and of defection from him according to that word, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Beware leſt their be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief</hi> (and there the fruit of it) <hi>to depart from the living God.</hi> And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is no wonder that unbelief travels in birth, till that curſed child of apoſtaſie be brought forth; not only becauſe of this, that an unbeliever loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the thought of the excellency of Chriſt, but alſo becauſe he increaſeth in his thoughts of love towards his Idols; for Chriſt doth decreaſe in thoſe who misbeſieve, and their Idols do increaſe in their love, and in their deſires, and in their eſtimation.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. There is this ſixth diſadvantage in the ſin of unbelief, it hindereth the communication of many ſingle workings and tokens of the love and favor of the moſt High, according to that ſad word that is in <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.58. at the cloſe, <hi>He could not do many mighty works there, becauſe of their unbelief.</hi> Unbelief, as it were, laid a reſtraint on Chriſt, that he could not effectuat thoſe things which he was willing to perform. And to ſhut up our diſcourſe at this time, I would only add theſe two aggravations which may ſomewhat enforce what we have ſpoken. I ſay, there are theſe two aggravations in the ſin of unbelief, even in his own who have a right (&amp; alſo his call) to believe. 1. That after that Chriſt hath given moſt ſenſible diſcoveries of himſelf (<hi>Wherein we have ſeen him,</hi> as it were, <hi>face to face</hi>) yet ye will not believe. This is clear from <hi>John</hi> 6.36. <hi>Though ye have ſeen me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>yet ye do not belive in me.</hi> There
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:178801:36"/> is not a manifeſtation of Chriſts preſence, but it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> this, believe on the Son of God. 2. That not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding of the ſignal demonſtrations of the power of Chriſt, yet though it were the mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome luſt and Idol within them, yet they will not believe, but upon new temptations will doubt of his love to them. Chriſt preacheth Faith by his Word; he preacheth Faith by his ſufferings; he preacheth Faith by his diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; he preacheth Faith by his promiſes; he preacheth Faith by his rods: and if theſe five in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments will not ingage your hearts to believe, who can move them? Doth not his two wounds in his precious hands, preach out this point of Faith, Believe him? Doth not that hole ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in his ſide, preach this doctrine, <hi>That we ſhould believe in him?</hi> And theſe two wounds that he received in his precious feet, do they not preach this, <hi>That we ſhould believe on a crucified Saviour?</hi> And we would only ſay this, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is the ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And I would have a Chriſtian making this four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold uſe of ſuch a diſpenſation as that (which is moſt ordinarily) when convictions of our duty to believe, and ſome deſires to cloſe with Chriſt,

Infinite Majeſty could give no gift greater then his Son, and infinite poverty could receive no other gift ſo ſutable as Chriſt; It was the moſt noble gift that Heaven could give, and it is the greateſt advantage for earth to receive it.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the noble object of Faith; look to the eminent depths of Chriſts condeſcendency, and then you will be provoked to love him. Was it not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite love that made Chriſt to ly three dayes in the Grave, that we might be through all the ages of eternity with him? Was it not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite condeſcendency that made his precious head wear a crown of Thorns, that we might
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:178801:39"/> eternally wear a crown of glory? Was it not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite condeſendency that made Chriſt wear a purple robe, that ſo we might wear that precious rob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of the righteouſneſs of the Saints? And was it not matchleſs condeſcendency, that Chriſt who know no ſin, was made ſin for us, that ſo we might become like unto him, and be made the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God in him?</p>
                  <p>But to come to that which we intend mainly to ſpeak upon at this time, which is that ſecond thing that we propoſed to ſpeak of from theſe words, and that is concerning the excellency of this grace of Faith, which we cleared, was hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den out in that, that Faith was called his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, which is called by way of eminency and excellency. There are many things in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which may ſweetly point out the precious excellency of this grace of Faith, and we ſhal only ſpeak to theſe things?</p>
                  <p n="1">I. The firſt thing that ſpeaketh out the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Faith, is this, it exerciſeth it ſelf upon a moſt noble object, to wit, Jeſus Chriſt; Faith and Love being the two arms of the immortal ſoul, by which we do imbrace a crucified Savior, which is often pointed at in Scripture, and we ſhal point at theſe three principal acts of Faith, which it exerciſeth on Jeſus Chriſt, as the object of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt is, to make up an union betwixt Chriſt and the believer (Faith being indeed an uniting grace, and that which knitteth the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to the head) and to make this more fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, we would point out a little what a ſweet
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:178801:40"/> harmony and correſpondency there is betwixt theſe two ſiſter-graces, to wit, Faith and Love. Faith is that nail which faſteneth the ſoul to Chriſt, and Love is that grace which driveth that nail to the head: Faith at firſt taketh but a tender grip of Chriſt, and then love cometh in, and maketh the ſoul take a more ſure grip of him. Secondly, ye may ſee their harmony in this, Faith is that grace which taketh hold (as it were) <hi>of the garment of Christ, and of his words;</hi> but Love (that ambitious grace) it taketh hold of the heart of Chriſt, and (as it were) his heart doth melt in the hand of Love. Thirdly, it may be ſeen in this, Faith is that grace which draweth the firſt draught of the likeneſs and Image of Chriſt upon a ſoul: but that accompliſhing grace of Love, it doth compleat theſe firſt draughts, and theſe imperfect linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Chriſts Image, which were firſt drawn on the ſoul. Fourthly, by Faith and love, the heart of Chriſt and of the believer are ſo united, that they are no more two, but one Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is this ſecond act that Faith exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth on Chriſt, and it is in diſcovering the match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs excellencies, and the tranſcendent properties of Jeſus Chriſt. O what large and precious co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries doth Faith make upon Chriſt! it is indeed that faithful ſpy, which doth alwayes bring up a good report of him: Hence it is, that Faith is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led underſtanding, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.2. becauſe it is that grace which revealeth much of the precious truth of that noble object.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And there is this third noble act of Faith,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:178801:40"/> exerciſing it ſelf upon Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> It maketh Chriſt precious to the ſoul, according to that word 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. <hi>unto you which believe, he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious.</hi> And if there were no other thing to ſpeak forth its worth but that, it is more then ſufficient; for no doubt this is the exerciſe of the higher Houſe to be dwelling on the contemplation of Chriſts beauty, and to have their ſouls tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with love towards him, and with joy in him.

Secondly,</hi> we do not take up, nor underſtand thoſe match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs priviledges which are given to them who are once in this eſtate. I am perſwaded, if this were believed, that <hi>he who is a ſervant doth not abide in the houſe for ever,</hi> though he that is a ſon doth; it would ſtir us up to more divine zeal in our purſuit after Chriſt.</p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:178801:43"/>
                  <p n="5">V. Fifthly, this likewiſe pointeth out the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the grace of ſaith; it is that grace by which all othere actions are pleaſant to God &amp; are taken off our hand; as is clear, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.4. <hi>By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent ſacrifice then Cain:</hi> which muſt be undeſtood even to all other duties. And that word, verſ. 6. <hi>Without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> ſpeaketh this alſo, that by faith we do exceedingly pleaſe him. And this is a moſt ſad and lamentable reproof unto many who are here, that their actions do not pleaſe God, becauſe they are not in faith. Would you know a deſcription of your prayers? (ye who are hypocrites, and deſtitute of the knowledge of God) It is this your prayers are the breach of the third command, <hi>in taking the Name of the Lord in vain, for which he will not hold you guiltleſs.</hi> And would you know what is your hearing of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons? <hi>It is an abomination to the Lord;</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that word in <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. <hi>To the unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and impure, is nothing clean.</hi> And as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> doth ſpeak, <hi>The plowing of the wicked is ſin;</hi> ſo that all your actions that ye go about, are but an offence to the Majeſty of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Now we would ſpeak to theſe two things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we proceed to the evidence of faith, to wit: Firſt, that there is a difference betwixt the direct act of faith, and the reflecting act of faith: for there may be a direct act of faith in a Chriſtian, when he is not perſwaded that he doth believe; but the reflecting acts of faith, are theſe which a Chriſtian hath when he is perſwaded in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:178801:44" rendition="simple:additions"/> that he doth believe. And we would ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly ſay, that there are many that do go down to their grave under that ſoul-deſtroying deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they are in the Faith, and yet never did know what Faith is. I am perſwaded there are many whom all the preachings in the world will never perſwade that they did never believe: their Faith being born with them, and it will die with them without any fruit; but faith being ſuch an excellent grace, and ſo advantagious, whereof we have ſpoken a few things, we ſhal ſpeak a little further of it: Firſt, in pointing out ſome evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences by which a Chriſtian may know whether or not he be in the Faith. Secondly, I ſhal give you ſome helps whereby Faith may be keeped in exerciſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Now there is this firſt evidence of Faith, that a Chriſtian who doth believe, he account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth abſence and want of fellowſhip with Chriſt, and communion with him, one of the greateſt and moſt lamentable croſſes that ever he had; as is clear, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 13.3. <hi>Lighten mine eyes,</hi> ſaid <hi>David,</hi> that is, <hi>let me behold, and be ſatisfied with thy face,</hi> and the motive that he backeth it with, is this, <hi>Leſt I ſleep the ſleep of death.

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:178801:44"/> of Chriſt. But I will tell you what an hypocrite doth moſt lament, and that is the want of reputation amongſt the Saints; that is the great god and Idol amongſt hypocrites, and thee which (when not enjoyed) hypocrites, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts lament moſt; the world, and the luſt of their eyes, when they want theſe then they cry out, <hi>They have taken away my gods, and what have I more?</hi> They think heaven can never make up he loſſe of earth. And certainly if many of us would examine our ſelves by this, we ſhould find our ſelves moſt defective: I would poſe all you who are here, who have taken on a name to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of Chriſt, whether or not ye have been content to walk thirty days in abſence from Chriſt, and yet never to lament it: Hath not Chriſt been thirty dayes and more in heaven without a viſite from you? And yet for all this, you have not cloathed your ſelves with ſackcloath: I will not ſay that this is an undeniable evidence of the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall want of the grace of faith; but it doth eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove this, that the perſon who hath come this length, hath loſt much of his primitive love, and much of that high eſteem, which he ought to have of matchleſſe Chriſt: what can you find in this world, that maketh you converſe ſo little with heaven? I think that it is the noble encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of a Chriſtian, when he is going down to his grave, that he hath this where with to comfort himſelf, <hi>I am to change my place, but not my company.</hi> Death to the believing Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an being a bleſſed tranſition and tranſportation to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:178801:45"/> a more immediat, conſtant, and uninterrupted enjoyment of God: But I believe, that if all who have the name of Believers in this genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould go to heaven, they might have, this to ſay, I am now not only to change my place but alſo my company: For theſe ſeventy years I have been converſant with my Idols, but now I am to converſe with more bleſſed, divine and excellent company. O that ye might be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to purſue much after an abſent Chriſt! Were it not a ſweet period of our life, to breath out our laſt breath in his arms, and to be living in the faith of being eternally with him, which might be founded upon his Word.</p>

There is this ſecond evidence of one that is in the Faith: They do endeavor to advance that neceſſary work of the mortification of their Idols, according to that word 1 John 3.3. <hi>Every man that hath this hope in him, purifieth himſelf, even as he is pure.</hi> Acts 15.9. <hi>Faith it purifieth the heart.</hi> And concerning this evidence (leaſt any ſhould miſtake it) I would ſay theſe things to you. Firſt the mortification of a Chriſtian, as long as he is here below, it doth more conſiſt in reſolutions than in attainments, it is certain, that there are high attainments of a Chriſtian, in the mortification of his Idols; but his reſolutions go far above his performances. Secondly, we would ſay this. That thoſe Chriſtians who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver came this length in Chriſtianity, to make that an univerſal concluſion, and full reſolution, <hi>What have I to do any more with Idols?</hi> They
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:178801:45"/> may ſuſpect themſelves, that they are not in the Faith: For a Chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſtian that is in Chriſt, he is univerſal in reſolutions, though he be not ſo in practice, but defective in performances. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian may have big reſolutions with weak per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances; for reſolutions will be at the gate of heaven, before practice come from the border of hell; there being a long diſtance betwixt reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and practice, and the one much ſwifter then the other. And thirdly, We would like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, ſay that ye who never did know what it was to endeavour (by prayer and the exerciſes of other duties) the mortification of your luſts and Idols, ye may be afraid, that ye have not yet the hope of ſeeing him as he is. And I would ſay this to many who are ſetled upon their lees, and who never did know what it was to ſpend one hour in ſecret prayer for mortifying an Idol, that they would beware, leſt that curſe be paſt in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven againſt them. <hi>I would have purged you, and ye would not be purged, therefore ye ſhall not be purged any more till ye die.</hi> That iniquity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to commune with Chriſt in the work of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>;ecret mortification, I ſay; that <hi>iniquity ſhall not be purged away.</hi> And we would once ſeriouſly deſire you by that dreadfull ſentence that Chriſt ſhall paſſe againſt you, and by the love you have to your immortal ſouls, and by the pains of thoſe everlaſting torments in hell, that ye would ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſet about the work of ſpiritual mortification, that ſo ye may evidence that ye have believed, and that ye have the ſoul-comforting hope of eternal
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:178801:46"/> life. I would only ſpeak this one word to you, and deſire you ſeriouſly to ponder it: What if within twelve hours hereafter a ſummons were given to you, without continuation of dayes, to compear before the ſolemn and dreadful Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of that impartial Judge, Jeſus Chriſt? what ſuppoſe ye, would be your thoughts? Will you examine your own conſcience, what you think would be your thoughts, if ſuch ſummons were given unto you: I am perſwaded of this, <hi>That your knees would ſmite one againſt another, and your faces would gather paleneſs,</hi> ſeeing your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience would condemn you, <hi>That you had been weighed in the ballance and found light:</hi> O think ye that ye can both fight and triumph in one day? Think ye that ye can fight and overcome in one day? Think ye your luſts and unmortified cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions ſo weak, and faint-hearted an enemy, that upon the firſt appearance of ſuch imaginary champions (as moſt part of us are in our own eyes) that your idols would lay down arms, and let you trample on them? Believe me, mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not a work of one day, or one year, but it is a work will ſerve you all your time, begin as ſoon as you will; and therefore ſeeing you have ſpent your dayes in the works of the fleſh, it is time that now you would begin and purſue after him, whoſe work is with him, and whoſe reward ſhall come before him.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Now there is this third evidence, by which a Chriſtian may know whether he be in the faith or not; &amp; it is, that Chriſt is matchleſs and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:178801:46"/> unto ſuch an one, according to that word, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7. <hi>To you that believe, Chriſt is precious.</hi> And that word that <hi>Luke</hi> hath in his 7. chap. at the cloſe: <hi>That ſhe to whom much was forgiven, loved much.</hi> Now leſt this likewiſe ſhould prove a diſcouragement to any, I would only have you take notice of this, that a Chriſtian may be a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, and yet want the ſenſible diſcoveries of this, that Chriſt is matchleſly precious to him: but this is certain, that when they are in the live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſe of Faith, it is impoſſible then for them not to eſteem Chriſt matchleſs: and I would ſpeak this likewiſe to many who are here; Have you not been living theſe ten years in Faith? And I would poſe you with this: Eſteem you not your Idols more matchleſs then Chriſt and more of worth then he? It is impoſſible that there can be any lively exerciſe of faith, and not eſteem Chriſt matchleſs. It is not to ſay it with your mouth and contradict it with your heart, will do the buſineſs: for if your heart could ſpeak, it would ſay, I would ſell Chriſt <hi>for thirty pieces of ſilver;</hi> but mine idols would I ſell at no rate. Are there not many of you who love the world and its pleaſures, better then eternity of joy? O! know you not that word, O ye deſperately ignorant of the truths of God! <hi>That he who loveth the world, the love of the Father is not in him?</hi> And yet notwithſtanding of the light of the Word, yet you would ſell your immortal ſouls, with <hi>Eſau for a moſs of pottage.</hi> O! but it is a poor bargain, when you have ſold the eternity of joy, for a paſſing world, and for its
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:178801:47"/> tranſitory delights! I would earneſtly know what ſhal be your thoughts in that day, when you ſhall be ſtanding upon the utmoſt line betwixt time and eternity? O! what will be your thoughts at that day? But you are to follow on to endleſs pain, by appearance, and then you are to leave your idols. I ſhall only deſire that you may read the word, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 10.3. <hi>What will ye do in the day of viſitation, and in the deſolation which ſhal come from far? To whom will ye flee for help? And where will ye leave your glory?</hi> You ſhall then preach mortification to the life, though all the time of mortification ſhall be then cut off. O but to hear a worldly minded man, when eternity of pain is looking him in the face, preach out concerning the vanity of this world, might it not preſwade you, that the world is a fancy and a dream that ſhal flee away, and ſhal leave you in the day of your greateſt ſtrait?</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. And there is this fourth evidence of faith, that a Chriſtian who doth truly believe, he is that Chriſtian who entertaineth a divine jealouſie, and a holy ſuſpition of himſelf, whether or not he doth believe. I love not that faith which is void of fear: this was clear in the practice of believing <hi>Noah,</hi> that though by faith he built the Ark yet he had fear mixed with his faith. I know that there are ſome who are ignorant concerning this, what it is to doubt concerning eternal peace? and more, it is not every one that doubteth, that certainly ſhal get heaven, fore I think an hypocrite may doubt concerning his eternal ſalvation; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I think the exerciſe of an hypocrite under
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:178801:47"/> his doubtings, it is more the exerciſe of his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then the exerciſe of his conſcience. And I may ſay, that if all the exerciſe of the Law, which is preached in theſe dayes, were narrowly ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, it would be more the exerciſe of light, then the exerciſe of conſcience. We ſpeak theſe things as our doubt, which was never our exerciſe, and we make theſe things our publick exerciſe, which was never our private and chamber-exerciſe. And I think that if all that a Chriſtian did ſpeak to God in prayer, were his exerciſe, he would ſpeak leſs, and wonder more. We would be ſpeechleſs when we go to God; for often if we did ſpeak no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but our exerciſe, we would have nothing to ſay. And certainly it is true, that often we fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that woful ſin of <hi>deſperate lying againſt the holy Ghoſt,</hi> by flattering God with our mouth, and lying unto him with our tongue. And I ſhall only ſay theſe two words, there are ſome who have this for their great deſign, <hi>viz.</hi> they would be at peace with their conſcience, and alſo they would beat peace with their idols: they would gladly recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile conſcience and their idols together. That is their great deſign. And there are ſome whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is a little more refined; they ſtudy rather to be reconciled with their conſcience, then to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled with God: Their great aim they ſhoot at, is this, to get their conſcience quieted, though they know not what it is to have the ſoul-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting peace of God to quiet them.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. Now there is this laſt evidence of Faith, that juſtifying faith is a faith which putteth the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:178801:48"/> Chriſtian to be much in the exerciſe of thoſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by which it may be maintained; for we muſt keep faith as the <hi>apple of our eye:</hi> and for that end, I would only give you theſe three things, by which faith muſt be kept in exerciſe; and a real Chriſtian will be endeavoring, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſome meaſure, to attain unto theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It keepeth faith much in exerciſe, to be much in marking and taking notice of the divine exerciſe, and proofs of the love of God, wherewith a Chriſtian doth meet, as is clear from that word in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Experience worketh hope.</hi> I durſt be bold to charge the moſt part that are indeed in Chriſt with this, that they are too little in remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and taking notice of the experiences of his love. You ſhould mark the place of your expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and much more you ſhould mark the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience it ſelf, as is clear from Scripture, that the very place where Chriſtians did meet with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in ſuch an enjoyment of God, they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked it, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 1.1. <hi>By the rivers of Chebar the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens were opened, and I ſaw the viſions of God.</hi> And <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.30. <hi>Jacob called the place Peni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>l,</hi> The place of being, after ſeeing of the face of God, it was ſo remarkable unto him. And we conceive that you would mark theſe two things mainly in your practice. Firſt, you would mark, if you can poſſibly, the firſt day of your cloſing with Chriſt, and your coming out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> and we may allude unto that command (if not more then allude to it) in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.1. <hi>Obſerve the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of Abib, and keep the Paſſeover unto the Lord
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:178801:48"/> thy God; for in the moneth of Abib, the Lord thy God brought thee out of the land of Egypt.</hi> And ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we would have you much in marking theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences which have encreaſed your faith, and which have ſtrengthened your love, and which have made you mortifie your idols. Theſe are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences eſpecially to be marked.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Faith is kept in exerciſe, and we win to the lively aſſurance of our intereſt in God, which we would preſs upon you, by being much in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of ſecret prayer O! but many love much to pray when abroad, who never loved to pray when alone; and that is a deſperate ſign of hypocriſie, according to that <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.5. it is ſaid of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites; <hi>They love to pray ſtanding in the Synagogues, and in the corners of the ſtreet, that they might be ſeen of men.</hi> But it is never ſaid of theſe perſons, that they love to pray alone, only they loved to pray in Synagogues; but is is ſecret and retired prayers by which faith muſt be kept in exerciſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And there is this likewiſe that we would preſs upon you, that you would be much in ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying communion and fellowſhip with God, that ſo your faith may be kept in life. And, O what a bleſſed life were it, each day to be taken up to the top of the Mount <hi>Piſga,</hi> and there to behold that promiſed land, to get a refreſhing ſight of the crown every morning, which might make us walk with joy all along the day! The heart of a Chriſtian ought to be in heaven, his converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ought to be there, his eyes ought to be there; and I know not what of a Chriſtian ought to be
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:178801:49"/> out of heaven (even before his going there) ſave his lumpiſh tabernacle of clay, which cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit incorruption till he be made incorruptible. And I ſhal ſay no more but this, many of us are readier to betray him with a kiſs, and crucifie him afreſh, then to keep communion with him: but <hi>wo eternally be to him by whom the Son of man is betrayed, and that doth crucifie Chriſt afreſh: I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THere are two great rocks upon which a Chriſtian doth ordinarily daſh in his way and motion toward his reſt. 1. The rock of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and carnal confidence, ſo that when Chriſt dangleth them upon his knees, and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth them with the breaſts of his conſolations, and maketh their cup to over-flow, then they cry out, <hi>My mountain ſtandeth ſtrong, I ſhall never be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> And 2. the rock of misbelief and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, ſo that when he hideth his face, and turneth back the face of his Throne, then they cry out; <hi>Our hope and ſtrength is periſhed from the Lord.</hi> We know not what it is to bear our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments by humility, nor out croſſes hy patience and ſubmiſſion. O! but misbelief and jealouſie are bad interpreters of dark diſpenſations: they know not what it is to read theſe myſterious cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of divine providence, except they be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the legible characters of ſenſe: misbelief is big with child of twins, and is travelling till it bring forth apoſtaſie and ſecurity: and no doubt, he is a bleſſed Chriſtian that hath overcome that woful idol of misbelief, and doth walk by that Royal law of the Word, and not by that changea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rule of diſpenſations.

                  <p>There are three great enemies of Chriſt, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, hypocriſie, and prophanity. Misbelief is a bloody ſin, hypocriſie is a ſilent ſin, profanity is a crying ſin, thoſe are mother evils. And I ſhall give you theſe differences betwixt them: Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief crucifieth Chriſt under the vail of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, hypocriſie crucifieth Chriſt under the vail of love, and profanity putteth him to open ſhame.

                  <p>Thirdly, there are ſome who certainly have ſome hope of eternal life, but content themſelves with a ſmal meaſure of aſſurance; &amp; theſe I would befeech, that ye would be more endeavoring to make your calling and election ſure, and would be endeavoring to ſee your names written in the ancient Records of heaven. And this we ſhal preſs
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:178801:55"/> upon you by ſeveral arguments. 1. Thoſe ſtrong and ſubtil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; and ſoul-deſtroying deluſions that are amongſt many, who conceive they do believe (as we were ſaying) and are <hi>pure in their own eyes, who yet are not purged from their iniquities.</hi> O, are there not many of us that are in a golden dream, that ſuppoſe <hi>we are eating; but when we awake, our ſoul is empty;</hi> whoſe faith is a Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſick notion, that hath no foundation, but mans apprehenſion? And this ſhall never beare us through the gates of death, nor convey us in unto eternity of joy. 2. May not this preſs you to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after aſſurance, that it is the compendious way to ſweeten all your croſſes, as is clear from <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.17.18. where the conviction of this made <hi>Habakkuk</hi> to rejoyice <hi>in the God of his ſalvation though the fig tree did not bear fruit, and the labor of the olive did fail, and there were no ſweetneſs to be found in the vine.</hi> And from <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. when they take joyfully the ſpoiling of their goods <hi>knowing within themſelves that they had a better and an enduring ſubſtance.</hi> This is indeed that tree, which if we caſt into the waters of <hi>Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>h,</hi> they will preſently become ſweet: for is it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the child of hope to be much anxious about theſe things that he meets with here, when he ſincerely knoweth that commandment ſhal come forth: <hi>Lift up your heads, for the day of your eternal redemption draweth near;</hi> even the day when all the rivers of his ſorrows ſhal ſweetly run into the Ocean of everlaſting delight? 3. A Chriſtian that is much in aſſurance, he is much in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:178801:55"/> and fellowſhip with God; as is clear from the <hi>Song</hi> 1.13.14. and <hi>Song</hi> 2.3. where when once ſhe cometh to that, to be perſwaded that Chriſt was her beloved, then ſhe ſate down under his ſhadow, and his fruit was pleaſant unto here taſte; for the aſſured Chriſtian doth taſte of theſe crums that fall from that higher Table; and no doubt, thoſe that have taſted of that old wine, will not ſtraightway deſire the new, becauſe the old is better. And then, fourthly, it is the way to keep you from apoſtaſie, and making defection from God: Faith is that grace that will make you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue with Chriſt in all his temptations; as is clear from 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1 10. where this is ſet down as a fruit of <hi>making our calling and election ſure,</hi> that if we do theſe things, we ſhall never fail. Faith maketh a Chriſtian to live a dependent life: For would you know the <hi>Motto</hi> of a Chriſtian? It is this <hi>ſelf diffidence,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt-dependence;</hi> as is clear from that word in the <hi>Song</hi> 8.5. that while we are walking through this wilderneſs, <hi>we are leaning upon our well-beloved.</hi> 5. This aſſurance will help a Chriſtian to overcome many tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. There are four ſorts of temptations that aſſault the Chriſtian: There are temptations of deſire, temptations of love, temptations of hope, and temptations of anxiety, all which a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian through this noble grace of aſſurance, may ſweetly overcome. He that hath once made Chriſt his own, what can he deſire but him? As <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.4. <hi>One thing have</hi> I <hi>deſired of the Lord.</hi> What can he love more then Chriſt, or love beſides
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:178801:56"/> Chriſt, all his love being drowned, as it were, in that Ocean of his excellencies, and a ſweet complacency found in the enjoyment of him. And as to hope, will not aſſurance make a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian cry forth, <hi>Now, Lord, what wait I for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> mine hope is in thee.</hi> And when the heart is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious, doth not aſſurance make the Chriſtian to <hi>hear the indignation of the Lord,</hi> and partiently ſubmit unto the croſs, ſince there is a ſweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between his croſs and his Crown? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.35.36. <hi>If he ſuffer with him, he ſhal alſo reign with him.</hi> And laſtly, there is this argument to preſs you to aſſurance, that it ſweetneth the thoughts of death. It maketh death unto a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, not the King of terrors, but the King of deſires: And it is upon theſe grounds that aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance maketh death refreſhful unto a Chriſtian. 1. He knoweth that it is the funeral of all his miſeries, and the birth-day of all his bleſſed and eternal enjoyments. 2. That it is the corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion day of a Chriſtian, and the day when he ſhall have that marriage betwixt Chriſt and him ſweetly ſolemnized: and that when he is to ſtep that laſt ſtep, he knoweth that death will make him change his place, but not his company. And O that we could once win unto this, to ſeal that concluſion without preſumption, <hi>My Beloved is mine, and I am his;</hi> We might without preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, ſing one of the Songs of <hi>Sion,</hi> even while we are in this ſtrange land! And taking Chriſt in our arms, might ſweetly cry forth: <hi>Now letteſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THere are three moſt precious and cardinal graces which a Chriſtian ought mainly to purſue; there is that exalting grace of Faith, that comforting grace of Hope, and that aſpiring grace of Love: And if once a Chriſtian did take up that heavenly difference that is betwixt theſe ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-graces, he might be provoked to move after them moſt ſwiftly, as the chariots of <hi>Aminadab.</hi> And there is this difference between theſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; Faith is a ſober and ſilent grace: Hope is a patient and ſubmiſſive grace: Love is an ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and impatient grace. Faith cryeth out; O <hi>my ſoul! be ſilent unto God.</hi> Hope cryeth out, I will wait patiently for the Lord, <hi>until the viſion ſhal ſpeak.</hi> But Love, it cryeth out, <hi>How long art thou a coming?</hi> And it is waiting to hear the ſound
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:178801:57"/> of his feet coming <hi>over the mountains of ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> That is the Motto of Hope, <hi>Quod defertur, non aufertur;</hi> that which is delayed, ſaith Hope, is not altogether taken away, and made void: And that may be the divine embleme of the grace of Love. It is Sight, infolding Deſire in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> arms, and it is deſire cloathed with wings, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon Delay and Impediments. There is this ſecond difference between theſe graces; the grace of Faith, it embraceth the truth of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes: the grace of Hope, it embraceth the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the thing that is promiſed: but that exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting grace of Love; it imbraceth <hi>the Promiſer.</hi> Faith cryeth out, <hi>Hath he ſpoken it? he will alſo do it.</hi> Hope cryeth out, <hi>Good is the word of the Lord, be it unto thy ſervant according to thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</hi> And Love it cryeth out in an higher note, <hi>As is the apple tree amongſt the trees of the wood ſo is my well-Beloved amongſt the ſons.</hi> Thirdly, there is that difference between theſe graces; Faith, it overcometh temptations: Hope, it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh difficulties; but Love ſtayeth at home, and divideth the ſpoil. There is a ſweet corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence between thoſe graces, in this, Faith it fighteth and conquereth: and Hope, it fighteth and conquereth, but Love, it doth enjoy the tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies of the victory. And fourthly, there is this difference, the noble grace of Faith, it ſhal once evaniſh into ſight. That noble grace of Hope, it ſhall once vaniſh into poſſeſſion and enjoyment, but that conſtant grace of Love, it ſhal be the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap> companion of a Chriſtian, and ſhall walk in
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:178801:57"/> with him unto the ſtreets of the <hi>New Jeruſalem.</hi> And I would ask you that queſtion, What a day ſhal it be when Faith ſhal cede to Sight? What a day ſhal it be when Hope ſhal yeeld its place to Love; and Love and Sight ſhal eternally fit down and ſolace themſelves in theſe bleſſed my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, theſe everlaſting conſolations of heaven, world without end? And fifthly, there is this difference, leſs will ſatisfie the grace of Faith, and the grace of Hope, then will ſatisfie the grace of Love. Faith it will be content with the promiſe, and Hope will be content with the thing that is promiſed; but that ambitious grace of Love, it will be only content with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſer. Love claſpeth its arms about that precious and noble object Jeſus Chriſt. Love is a ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious grace, it oftentimes cryeth forth, <hi>They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.</hi> So that Faith is oftentimes put to reſolve ſuſpicions of Love. I can compare theſe three graces to nothing ſo fitly, as to thoſe three great worthies that <hi>David</hi> had: Theſe three graces they will break thorow all difficulties, were it an hoſt of <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> that ſo they may pleaſure Chriſt, and may drink of the well of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> that well of everlaſting conſolation that floweth from beneath the throne of God. Love is like <hi>Noahs</hi> dove, it never findeth reſt for the ſole of its foot, until once it be within that Ark, that place of repoſe Jeſus Chriſt. And ſixthly, there is this laſt difference between them, Faith taketh hold upon the faithfulneſs of Chriſt.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:178801:58"/> Hope taketh hold upon the goodneſs of Chriſt; but Love it taketh hold upon the heart of Chriſt. And think ye not it muſt be a pleaſant and ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refreſhing exerciſe, to be continually taken up in embracing him that is that eternal admiration of Angels? Muſt it not be an excellent life, dayly to be feeding upon the <hi>finest of the wheat, and to be ſatisfied with honey out of the rock?</hi> O, but heaven muſt be a pleaſant place! And if once we would but taſte of the firſt ripe grapes, and a cluſter of wine that groweth in that pleaſant land, might we not be conſtrained to bring up a good report of it?</p>
                  <p>But now to come to that which I purpoſe mainly to ſpeak of at this time. The laſt thing concerning Faith that we propoſed from the words, was, the object upon which Faith exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeth it ſelf, which is here ſet down to be the <hi>Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And that we may ſpeak to this more clearly, we ſhal firſt ſpeak a litle to the negative, what things are not the fit object of Faith: And then to the poſitive, ſhowing how this Name of God, and of his Son Chriſt, is that ſure ground upon which a Chriſtian may pitch his faith. For the firſt, ye muſt know that a Chriſtian is not to build his faith upon ſenſe, nor ſenſible enjoyments. Senſe may be an evidence of Faith, but it muſt not be the foundation of Faith. I know there are ſome that ofttimes cry out, <hi>Except I put my fingers into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into the hole of his ſide, I will not believe.</hi> And indeed it is a myſtery unto
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:178801:58"/> the moſt part of us, to be exerciſing Faith upon a naked word of promiſe, abſtracted from ſenſe: to love an abſent Chriſt, and to believe on an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Chriſt, are the two great myſteries of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity. But that ſenſe is no good foundation for Faith, may appear. 1. That Faith which is buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon fenſe, is a moſt unconſtant, a moſt flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuating and tranſient Faith. I know ſenſe hath its fits of love, and as it were, hath its fits of faith. Sometimes ſenſe is ſick of love, and ſometimes ſenſe is ſtrong in faith; but ere ſix hours go about, ſenſe may be ſick of jealouſie, and ſick of misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>life, as ye will ſee from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.6.7. Senſe that bold thing, it will inſtantly cry out, <hi>My moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain standeth ſtrong, I ſhal never be moved:</hi> but behold how ſoon it changeth its note, <hi>Thou hideſt thy face, and I was troubled.</hi> At one time it will cry forth, <hi>Who is like unto him that pardoneth ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and that paſſeth over tranſgreſſions?</hi> But ere many hours go about, it will ſing a long upon another key, and cry out, <hi>Why art thou become unto me as a liar, and as waters that fail?</hi> 2. That Faith which is built upon ſenſe, it wanteth the promiſe of bleſſedneſs; for this is annexed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, that is founded upon the word, according to that in <hi>John</hi> 20.29. <hi>Bleſſed are thoſe that have not ſeen, and yet have believed.</hi> Nor hath that Faith that is built upon ſenſe, ſuch a ſolide joy waiting on it, as Faith that is built upon the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked word of promiſe; as may be cleared from that word, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. where Faith exerciſing it ſelf upon Chriſt not ſeen, maketh a Chriſtian <hi>to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:178801:59"/> rejoice with joy unſpeakeable, and full of glory:</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> joy that doth not attend believing founded upon ſenſe. 3. That Faith that is built upon ſenſe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> giveth not much glory to God: for Faith that is built upon ſenſe, it exalteth not the faithfulneſſ of God, it exalteth not the Omnipotency of God. I will tell you what is the divinity of ſenſe; Let me ſee, and then I will believe, but it kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth not what it is to believe upon truſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>the Lord hath ſpoken in his Holineſs.</hi> And in effect, Faith that is built upon ſenſe, is no faith; even as <hi>Rom</hi> 8. <hi>Hope that is ſeen, is no hope:</hi> and therefore when the Lord ſeeth a Chriſtian making ſenſe an Idol, that he will not believe but when he ſeeth or feeleth, this doth often provoke the Majeſty of the Lord to withdraw himſelf from that Chriſtian, and to deny him the ſweet influences of Heaven, and thoſe conſolations that are above, ſo that in an inſtant he hath both his ſenſe and his faith to ſeek.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A Chriſtian is not to make his graces the object of his Faith; that is, when a Chriſtian doth behold love burning within him, when he doth be hold influences to prayer increaſing, and mortification waxing ſtrong, he is not to build his faith upon them: this was condemned in the Church, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.14. compared with the 15. verſe: I <hi>made thee perfect with my comlineſs?</hi> but the uſe that thou didſt make of it, thou <hi>didſt put thy truſt in thy beauty,</hi> and then thou <hi>didſt play the harlot.</hi> It is certain that grace when it is the object of our Faith, it doth provoke God to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:178801:59"/> blaſt the lively exerciſe thereof, and to make a Chriſtian oft times have that complaint; <hi>Wo to me, my leanneſs, my leanneſs teſtifieth to my face.</hi> I will tell you three great myſteries in Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity about grace. The firſt is, to ride marches between theſe two; not to deny what they have, and yet to be denyed to what they have: Many times there is grace-denying, and not ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying; but this is that we would preſs upon you, to be denyed to grace, according to that which is recorded of <hi>Moſes, His face did ſhine, and he knew it not:</hi> He did misken it, as it were, and was not at all puffed up with it: for ſo the words, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, may run. Secondly, it is a great difficulty for a Chriſtian to be denyed to his ſelf-denyal, to be humble in his being humble: for if pride can have no other foundation, it will build it ſelf upon humility; and a Chriſtian will grow proud in this, that he is growing humble. Thirdly, it is a difficulty for a Chriſtian to examine his gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing in grace, and not to be puffed up. It is certain a Chriſtian ought to examine his growth in grace humbly, according to that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.8. <hi>My ſoul followeth hard after thee, thy right hand upholdeth me,</hi> He doth not only take notice of this, that his ſoul did <hi>follow after God;</hi> but of the meaſure of that purſuit, <hi>my ſoul followeth hard af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thee;</hi> and yet ſweetly acknowledgeth it was not his own feet which carried him, nor his own hand that kept him from falling.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Ye are not to build your faith upon your works, and upon the righteouſneſs of the Law.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:178801:60"/> I need not ſtand long to refute that practical Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery that is amongſt us, that thinketh we can go to heaven through a covenant of works. I told you, not long ſince, what your going to heaven through a covenant of works ſpeaketh, even this horrible blaſphemy, that it was an act of mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruous folly to ſend Chriſt to die for ſinners: for if you can go to heaven without him, was not then Chriſt crucified in vain? And I would tell you now, that this ſpeaketh out your damnable ignorance of the weakneſs and deceitfulneſs of your own hearts. O ye that are ſo great defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Salvation by the covenant of works, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, what is the reaſon that ye break the covenant of works oftener then any? For there is none that thinketh they will go to heaven this way, but thoſe that are the greateſt breakers of the covenant of works. And is not that inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent, and contradictory Divinity, your faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting your practice, and your practice telling you that your faith is a lie?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We muſt not mix our own righteouſneſs with Chriſts as the object of our believing: This is indeed an evil that often lodgeth in the boſom of the moſt refined hypocrite, when Satan can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prevail to exclude Chriſt altogether, then he is content with that whoriſh Woman to <hi>divide the child;</hi> and let the object of our Faith be half of Chriſt, and half of ſelf: And the truth is, many of theſe poor unwiſe ſons, who ſtay long in the place of breaking forth of children, do willingly hearken to this overture, for fear it be preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:178801:60"/> for ſuch poor wretches to meddle too bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the riches of Chriſt, but it were good ſuch weak ones would conſider that word, <hi>Rom.</hi>

                  <p n="5">5. We are not to make providence the object of our faith. I know there are ſome that ask the ground of their right of heaven, they will tell us that God hath been kind to them all their dayes; I would only ſay to ſuch, <hi>He may be feeding you unto the day of ſlaughter, and no man knoweth love or hatred by any thing that is before him.</hi> Thus much of the object of Faith negatively. And now to ſpeak to it poſitively, we ſee the Text hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth out Chriſt himſelf as that excellent and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat object of Faith, <hi>This is his Commandment, that we believe on the Name of his Son:</hi> And thus Faith cloſeth with Chriſt under a fourfold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.

Secondly, Faith cloſeth with Chriſt, as tendered freely in a covenant of promiſe: we would have had nothing to do with Chriſt, if he had not been given of the Father, and offered himſelf in a free covenant of promiſe; but he being thus holden forth upon terms of free Love, which doth utterly abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate hire, and ſo noble a proclamation iſſued forth under the great ſeal of Heaven, <hi>That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever will, may come and drink of the water of life freely.</hi> Upon this the poor creature draweth near by vertue of a right, and ſtretching out the arm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> of moſt enlarged affections, doth run upon him with that joyful ſhout, <hi>My Lord, my God:</hi> and then maketh an abſolute reſignation of it ſelf to him, which is holden out in the Scripture, by that ſweet expreſſion of kiſſing <hi>of the Son.</hi> And there are three parts of Chriſts bleſſed body that the Chriſtian muſt endeavor to kiſs and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace; the mouth of Chriſt, the hand of Chriſt, and the feet of Chriſt. The kiſſing of his feet importeth the exerciſe of love, the kiſſing of his hands, the exerciſe of ſubjection, and the kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:178801:61"/> of his mouth, the exerciſe of communion and fellowſhip with him. Thirdly, Faith clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth with Chriſt, as the purchaſer and meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cauſe of all the good we receive. He is the perſon that hath purchaſed all theſe things unto us, and there is not one blink of love, there is nor the ſmalleſt enjoyment that a Chriſtian meeteth with, but it is the price of the blood of Chriſt; Chriſts precious blood was laid down for it. Fourthly, Faith cloſeth with Chriſt as the efficient and worker of all our mercies; all our enjoyments are from him as the efficient cauſe; that is, he is the worker of all things in us, it is his preciouſs fingers that muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh that bleſſed work of grace, and they are from Chriſt as the diſpenſer of theſe things. Chriſt is the great ſteward of heaven that doth communicate unto believers all the treaſures of the higher Houſe; <hi>For him hath God the Father ſealed.</hi> O! but that word that Chriſt once ſpake, is much verified by himſelf, <hi>It is more bleſſed to give, then to receive.</hi> Chriſt is that fountain and treaſure in whom all our gifts and graces are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Faith it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, a caſting of <hi>our burden upon God, Pſal.</hi> 55.22. <hi>Caſt your burden upon God.</hi> And Faith it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>a coming unto God, Matth.</hi> 11.28. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to theſe different names, there are ſeven noble properties and matchleſs differences of this
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:178801:65"/> grace of Faith. The firſt is, that this is the grace by which a Chriſtian doth enjoy much commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God: hence it is called a <hi>looking,</hi> which importeth that Faith is a continual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the immortal ſoul upon that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and excellent object Jeſus Chriſt. There is that ſecond property of Faith, that it is that grace by which a communion with God is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; hence it is called, an <hi>abiding in God.</hi> It is that grace which maketh Chriſt and the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to dwel together. The third property of Faith is, that it is a moſt ſubmiſſive grace; hence it is called, a <hi>keeping ſilence unto God.</hi> Faith as it were, knoweth not what it is to repine. It is the noble excellency of Faith, it never knew what it was to miſconſtruct Chriſt. It is the noble ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Faith, it never knew what it was to paſs an evil report upon Chriſt. Faith it will promiſe good things to a Chriſtian in the darkeſt night: for when Love asketh Faith that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>Iſai</hi> 21.11.12. <hi>Watch-men, what of the night? Watch-men, what of the night?</hi> Or, when ſhal the morning break? Faith anſwereth it with the words that follow (only a little inver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the order) <hi>The night cometh and alſo the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi> The morning is approaching that admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of no following night. There is that fourth property of Faith, it is the grace that keepeth a Chriſtian in perſeverance, by its building upon the Rock: hence it is called, a <hi>leaning upon God:</hi> for a Chriſtian by faith, doth perpetually join himſelf to Chriſt, ſo that whatever trouble he
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:178801:66"/> be caſt into, by Faith he cometh up out of that <hi>wilderneſs, leaning upon his Beloved:</hi> and by Faith he is led up <hi>to the Rock that is higher then he,</hi> where he may ſit in ſaftey, and even <hi>laugh at death and deſtruction,</hi> when aſſailing him. There is that fifth property of Faith, that it is the grace that bringeth ſatisfaction: to the ſpiritual ſenſes of a Chriſtian, by a cloſe and particular application of Chriſt, as the nowriſhment of the ſoul: hence it is called, an <hi>eating of the fleſh of Chriſt.</hi> There are three ſenſes that Faith ſatisfieth; Faith ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freth the ſenſe of ſight, it ſatisfieth the ſenſe of taſte, and it ſatisfieth the ſenſe of touch. Faith will make a Chriſtian <hi>handle that eternal Word of life.</hi> Faith will make a Chriſtian ſee <hi>that noble plant of renown:</hi> and Faith will make a Chriſtian <hi>taſte and ſee how gracious the Lord is.</hi> And, no doubt, thoſe that have once ſatisfied their ſight, they will be longing to ſatisfie their taſte. There is that ſixth property of Faith, it is that grace which giveth reſt unto a Chriſtian: hence it is called, a <hi>caſting of our burden upon him.</hi> It is, as it were, the ſoul giving unto Chriſt that unſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable yoke of our iniquities, and taking from Chriſt that eaſie and portable yoke of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. And ſeventhly, there is that laſt property of Faith, it is that grace by which ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification is promoved: hence it is called, <hi>a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to Chriſt.</hi> It is the ſoul in a divine motion, and travelling from the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> unto th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Faith, it is the ſoul in a pleaſant motion from the land of the North, the land o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:178801:66"/> our captivity, unto the land of perfect liberty, all along going out <hi>by the footſteps of the flock, and walking in that new and living way,</hi> even in him <hi>who is the way, the truth, and the life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now for a more full application of this, we ſhal ſpeak but two things further. 1. We would have it conſidered, that there are ſome that come unto the covenant of promiſe with leſs dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, and after a more divine and Evangelick way; and there are ſome that cloſe with Chriſt in a more difficult and legal way: There are ſome that before they can come to Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> they muſt dwel fourty dayes at Mount <hi>Sinai:</hi> There are ſome before the decree of heaven ſhal be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to them, they muſt roar as an ox, and muſt cover themſelves with ſackcloath, having aſhes upon their heads: We muſt be a <hi>Benoni,</hi> before we be a <hi>Benjamin;</hi> that is, we muſt be a ſon of <hi>ſorrow,</hi> before we can be a ſon of <hi>conſolation.</hi> But this is certain, that Chriſt leadeth ſometimes ſome to himſelf through a valley of roſes. And I would only have you take notice of theſe two, which though we conceive they be not infallible in the rule, yet oftentimes experience maketh them out to be truth. 1. That there are three ſorts of perſons who are moſt ordinarily brought under great terror ere they cloſe with Chriſt. Firſt, thoſe who have committed ſome groſs and abominable ſin that is moſt contradicting unto the light of nature. Secondly, that perſon that ſinneth much againſt light before converſion: Hence it is obſerved in all the Books of the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:178801:67"/> Goſpel, and in the Book of the <hi>Acts,</hi> there was a more Goſpel and love-way of converting the <hi>Gentils,</hi> then was of converting the <hi>Jews:</hi> See <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. there is a ſharp law exerciſed amongſt them who had crucified the Lord of life: and <hi>Acts</hi> 9. <hi>Paul</hi> that had been a grievous perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, at his converſion, he is firſt ſtricken dead to the ground, before he be made a captive of the love of Chriſt, and conſtrained to cry out, <hi>What wilt thou have me to do?</hi> But look to <hi>Acts</hi> 8. and <hi>chap.</hi> 19. and there ye will find a more fair and ſmooth way of begetting ſons to Chriſt. And thirdly, that perſon that is much in conceit of his own righteouſneſes, he uſeth to be brought to Chriſt through much terror and exerciſe of the Law; that is clear in <hi>Paul,</hi> his condition alſo, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. and <hi>Asts</hi> 9. compared: and certainly whoever thinketh to come that length in ſelf-abaſement, and will count, as the Apoſtle doth in that Chapter, muſt dwel many days at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and learn his Arithmetick there. 2. We would have you take notice of this, that though the perſon that is brought to Chriſt in a more ſmooth and Evangelical way, may have the pree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency of the perſon that is brought to Chriſt, after a more legal and terrible way in ſome thing; yet we conceive that a Chriſtian that is brought to Chriſt through much of the exerciſe of the Law, and through many of the thunderings of Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> after he hath won to ſee his righ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in Chriſt, he is more conſtant in the exerciſe of Faith; and the reaſon of it is, becauſe that a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ptaking either of the time of our converſion, which is oftimes hid from thoſe perſons that are converted in a more Evangelick way; as likewiſe this, that thoſe perſons that are brought to Chirſt in a more Goſpel chariot, are ſometimes put to debates whether ever they were under the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the Law; and this maketh them often (as it were) to raze the foundation, and to cry forth, <hi>My hope and my ſtrength is periſhed from the Lord.</hi> And now to ſhut up our diſcourſe; we ſhal add this one word of exhortation, that ye would care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully lay hold upon that noble object, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe your faith upon him; and I ſhal ſay but this, that all theſe that have this noble grace of Faith, and that are heirs of that everlaſting inheritance, there is a fourfold crown prepared for you: there is a crown of life that is prepared for him that ſhal <hi>fight that good fight of Faith:</hi> but what may you ſay is a crown of life, except we have joy waiting upon that life? For what is life without joy, but a bitterneſs and a burden to it ſelf? therefore ye ſhal have <hi>a crown of joy;</hi> but what were a crown of life, and a joy, except we had the grace of holineſs, and were compleat in that? therefore ye ſhal have alſo <hi>a crown of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> but what were life, joy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>and righteouſneſs without glory? therefore ye ſhal have likewiſe <hi>a crown of glory:</hi> but what of all theſe, if that crown ſhould once fall from our head, and we ſhould be deprived of our Kingdom? therefore
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:178801:68"/> take this to make up the reſt, it is an <hi>eternal crown of glory.</hi> That word in <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. near the cloſe, <hi>the crown</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>doth not endure for ever;</hi> but this precious crown that the hands of Chriſt ſhal fix upon the head of an overco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Chriſtian, this is the motto that is engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon it, <hi>Unchangeable and Eternal, Eternal and Unchangeable.</hi> And, O what a day ſuppoſe ye that ſhal be, when that precious crown ſhal be put upon our heads? What think you will be the difference betwixt Chriſt and believers in heaven? They ſhal have theſe four crowns, which are indeed one; but Chriſt ſhal have upon his head many crowns, according to that word, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.12. But let me ſay one word alſo to you who are ſtrangers from God, and are deſtitute of the grace of Chriſt, and will not by faith cloſe with this excellent object, there is a four-fold crown that once ſhal be put upon your heads: but do not miſ-interprete the viſion, there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the <hi>Butler</hi> and the <hi>Baker:</hi> ye may propheſie good things to your ſelves, but there is a crown of death which ye ſhal once have put upon your heads, ye ſhal be always dying, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver able to die: There is a crown of ſorrow that ye ſhal have put upon your heads, when ye ſhal eternally ſigh forth that ſad lamentation; <hi>O to be annihilate and reduced unto nothing!</hi> When the reduction of you unto nothing would be a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, when ye ſhal be tormented in thoſe everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting flames. And I would ſay this by the way,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:178801:68"/> ye will be all miſerable and comfortleſs one to another: there will be no ground of conſolation that ye ſhal reap, for the community of your ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſhal increaſe the degrees of that ſorrow. And there is another crown alſo that ye ſhall put on, and that is <hi>a crown of ſin,</hi> in ſtead of that <hi>crown of righteouſneſs.</hi> Would ye know your exerciſe, O ye that are predeſtinate unto theſe everlaſting pains? would ye know your exerciſe? It is this, ye ſhal eternally <hi>blaſpheme and curſe</hi> the God that made you. I am perſwaded of this, that the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rots of hell will afflict you more, and doth, then that of the ſinning prepetually in hell. You would think nothing, many of you, to be in hell, if there were no pain there; for the exerciſe of ſin, it would be your delight and life: but be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of it, that when your conſcience is awaked, the exerciſe of ſinning ſhal exceedingly aggravate your pain. And there is this crown, laſtly, that ye ſhal put on, and that is, <hi>the crown of ſhame:</hi> The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> maketh mention of a <hi>crown of pride;</hi> but you that have put on that crown of pride, you ſhal once put on that crown of everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting <hi>confuſion and ſhame,</hi> when you ſhal not be able to lift up your eyes to him <hi>whom you have pierced.</hi> I would fain deſire you to know what would be your exerciſe at theſe three days, what will be your exerciſe when death ſhal be ſummo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning you to remove, and you ſhal firſt be entered heirs unto thoſe everlaſting pains. I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded you will reflect much: Will ye not reflect
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:178801:69"/> upon many Sermons that you have heard, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you have been invited to partake of the ſweet offers of ſalvation? I remember of one that upon his death bed cryed forth, <hi>A world for time, a world for one inch of time!</hi> Onethat perhaps did hold his head high, and no doubt was greater then the greateſt here: His crown would not purchaſe one inch of time, but dying with this, <hi>Call time again, call time again,</hi> that petition was denyed: and ſo ſhall it be, I fear, to the moſt part that are here. I think it was a pretty Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roglyphick of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> they painted Time with three heads: the firſt head that painted out Time that was paſt, <hi>was a greedy wolf gaping;</hi> which imported this, that our Time paſt was miſpent, &amp; there was nothing left, but like a wolf to gape for it again. And there was that ſecond head of a <hi>roaring lyon round,</hi> which imports the Time preſent, and for this end was ſo painted, that people might lay hold upon their preſent op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, otherwiſe it would be the matter of their ruine, and their eternal undoing. And there was that laſt head, which was of a <hi>deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful dog fawning,</hi> which ſignified that people they deceive themſelves with the Time to come, thinking they will be religious at their death; and that they will overcome at their death. But this is a flattery no better then the fawning of a mad dog. I think we may learn much of this, even to be provoked to lay hold upon our golden opportunities, that we ſell not our Time, but
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:178801:69"/> that we buy it. There are two things that a Chriſtian muſt not ſell; that is, ſell not the <hi>Truth,</hi> but buy it; and ſell not your <hi>Time,</hi> but buy it. I am perſwaded of this, that one moment of time is worth ten thouſand worlds, if impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. And I would ask you, What advantage ſhal you have of all things that you have tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted your ſelves about, when Time ſhal be no more? I ſuppoſe indeed this is an ordinary evil amongſt the people of this age, of which we have our own ſhare and portion. There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that envy godlineſs and the godly, <hi>the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ones that are in the earth,</hi> and think it is pleaſure to vent their malice againſt ſuch. I know that ordinary practice it is older, by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, then themſelves, that they preſecute godlineſs under the name of hypocriſie: They call godlineſs hypocriſie, and upon that account, they begin to ſpeak maliciouſly againſt it. Only I would ask you this queſtion, What will you ſay in that day when Chriſt will ask that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of you, that <hi>Gideon</hi> asked of <hi>Zeba</hi> and <hi>Zal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munna,</hi> Who are thoſe that you killed with your tongue? Muſt it not be anſwered, <hi>Every one did reſemble the perſon of a King?</hi> O! will you not believe? Will you not cloſe with Chriſt? I know it is ordinary that we run upon theſe two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams; ſometimes we do not believe the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the Law, &amp; ſometimes we will believe the promiſes of the Goſpel. But I would only deſire to know, what if it had been ſo ordered in the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:178801:70"/> infinite wiſdom of God, and that all the letters of this book ſhould have been threatnings, what ſhould have been our lot, if all the promiſes ſhould have been ſcraped out of it? But certainly this muſt be your lot, all the promiſes of the book of this covenant ſhall be taken from you, and all the curſes thereof ſhall be a fleeing roll that ſhal enter within your houſes, and there ſhal eternally remain. Know this, O you that are enemies to Chriſt, know it, and think upon it: <hi>Every battle of the warriour is with confuſed noiſe, and with garments rowled in blood:</hi> but that war which Chriſt ſhal have againſt the <hi>hypocrites in Zion,</hi> and thoſe that are ignorant of him, and will not cloſe with him, it ſhal be <hi>with fewel of fire, and eternal indignation.</hi> O! what will be your thoughts, ſuppoſe you, when Chriſt ſhal come with that two-edged ſword of the fury of the Lord, to enter to fight with you? It is no delightſome exerciſe. O that you were <hi>not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt,</hi> but <hi>altogether perſwaded to be Chriſtians;</hi> and that once Chriſt might conquer you with that two-edged ſword <hi>that proceedeth out of his mouth,</hi> that ſo you might ſubject your ſelves to him, and make him the object of your faith.

This Goſpel and glad tydings of the great Salvation, is come near unto you: And Chriſt is ſtanding at the everlaſting doors of your hearts, deſiring that ye would open unto him. There is that one great requeſt, which heaven this day hath to preſent unto you, and it is, that ye would at laſt embrace this great Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation freely offered by him. It is the thing for which ye are called to mourn this day, that ſince the dayes of your fathers, and ſince the beginning of your own dayes, ye have ſtopped your ears from the ſweet and chanting voice of this bleſſed Charmer. <hi>Ye would never dance to Chriſt when

                  </p>
                  <p>But to come to the words which we have read unto you: The Apoſtle in the former Chapter, had been diſcovering moſt divinely of the match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and incomparable excellencies which are in our Lord Jeſus. And in the firſt verſe of this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Chapter, he draweth forth an exhortation from his former doctrine, which in ſhort is this, That they would take heed to the bleſſed do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel, and not <hi>at any time to let it ſlip out of their minds;</hi> and that they would keep this Goſpel as a Jewel of great price, and would not ſell it, but that they would be induced to buy it. And this exhortation he preſſeth by two ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
                  <p>The firſt argument is in the ſecond verſe, where he ſaith, <hi>If the word spoken by angels was ſtedfaſt, and every tranſgreſſion and diſobedience received a juſt recompence of reward,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p n="2">II. The ſecond thing to be conſidered in the words, is, that the ſtroke and ruine of thoſe who flight this great Salvation, is certain and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it will ſurely come upon them: This is clear from theſe words, <hi>How ſhal we eſcape?</hi> As if he had ſaid, There is no imaginable way for us to eſcape, if we neglect (this) <hi>ſo great ſalvation.</hi> We may have a city of refuge when we are pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued by the Law, or when we are purſued by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions; and we may eſcape when we are pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued otherwayes by the Juſtice of God: but if once we ſlight this great Salvation, there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth no city of refuge (no door of eſcape left open) unto us: for where will the perſon flee that ſlighteth this great Salvation?</p>

                  <p n="4">4. There will be ſome of <hi>Felix</hi> humor found here to day, that will ſay, <hi>O Chriſt, go away at this time, and I will hear thee at a more convenient ſeaſon.</hi> But I ſay unto you, who will not hear me to day, nor embrance this great ſalvation, I ſhal defy all the Miniſters in <hi>Scotland</hi> to aſſure you, that ye ſhal get another offer, if ye ſend me away to day. There is not one that can or dare engage that the great ſalvation ſhal be in your offer any more.

                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5.

Oh! ſhal the great Salvation that ye have ſlighted ſo long, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> ſlighted this day alſo? And ſhal there be none to embrace it? Oh! enquire, and ſtand in aw, leſt the wrath of the moſt High purſue you.</p>
                  <p>Now I ſhal give you theſe ſeven conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which may provoke you not to ſlight, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mbrace this great Salvation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt conſideration, that the not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing this great ſalvation; is one of the greateſt
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:178801:81"/> acts of folly that can be, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.9. <hi>They have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the word of the Lord:</hi> and immeditatly it is ſubjoyned, <hi>And what wiſdom is in them?</hi> And ſo <hi>Solomon</hi> doth aſſure you, they cannot be wiſe who neglect this great Salvation, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Fools deſpiſe wiſdom and inſtruction.</hi> Therefore may I not ſay unto you, be ye who ye will, though ye were the greateſt heads of wit in all this place, ye are but ſtark fools, as long as ye neglect this. But would you be wiſe indeed, and wiſe unto eternal life? Then I intreat you, come and embrace this great Salvation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond conſideration to provoke you not to ſlight the great ſalvation, is this, that the ruine and deſtruction of the ſlighters of it, is moſt certain and infallible, <hi>Jer.</hi> 11.11. where ſpeaking of ſlighting the covenant, which is indeed the ſame great ſalvation, there is a <hi>therefore,</hi> put to the threatning. <hi>Therefore thus ſaith the Lord, I will bring evil upon them, which they ſhal not he able to eſcape.</hi> I defy you all, who are the ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this great Salvation, to find a back-door, when Juſtice ſhal purſue you; for there is no door to eſcape, if ye embrace not this great Salvations but <hi>the earth will diſcloſe your iniquity, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven will declare your ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, let this conſideration provoke you not to ſlight this great Salvation, that Chriſt is exceeding ſerious and earneſt that ye ſhould embrace it: And I think that <hi>Iſai.</hi> 28.23. ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth out his exceeding ſeriouſneſs, where ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:178801:81"/> times he beggeth of his hearers, that they would give ear and hear his voice, ſaying: <hi>Give ear, and hear my voice: hearken; and hear my ſpeech.</hi> What needeth all theſe exhortations, but that Chriſt is moſt ſerious that they would embrace the great Salvation? And, O that there were a perſon here to day, as ſerious to the bargain as Chriſt is! But be who ye will, that ſlight this great Salvation, believe me, the day is coming wherein ye ſhal cry out: Alace, for my ſlighting of it! Wilt thou therefore think preſently with thy ſelf, O thou ſlighter of this great Salvation! What wilt thou ſay of thy ſlighting it? When the devil ſhal be leading thee in thorow theſe dark gates of hell, O ſlighter of the Goſpel! how many alaces wilt thou cry, when thou ſhalt be paſſing thorow theſe dark gates into thy everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting priſon? Wilt thou not then cry out, O me, a ſlighter of the everlaſting Salvation! whether am I now going? Alace, now for my ſlighting of the Goſpel! And as thou paſſeſt thorow, thou ſhalt meet with numbers of miſerable comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. There is not one in that priſon, who can comfort thee; but many dreadful alaces ſhalt thou then both cry and hear, if thou embrace not this great Salvation.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Fourthly, let this provoke you not to ſlight the great Salvation, that ye will get it for a very look. O ye within this houſe to day, ye will get this great Salvation for one look, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 45.22. <hi>Look unto me and be ſaved, all the ends
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:178801:82"/> of the earth:</hi> For a very look ye will get this great Salvation: and do ye ever think to get heaven at a lower rate?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The fifth conſideration to provoke you not to ſlight this great ſalvation any more, is this, There is not one of you who is a ſlighter of is, but your ſlighting it ſhal increaſe your immortal bonds. Man or woman, be who thou wilt, when thou art ſlighting this great Salvation, thou art but platting a cord wherewith to bind thy ſoul eternally in theſe unquenchable flames, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 28.22. <hi>Be ye not mockers, lest your bonds be made ſtrong.</hi> I ſay therefore unto you, <hi>old men,</hi> mock not, <hi>lest your bonds be made ſtrong. Old women,</hi> near unto your graves, mock not, <hi>leſt your bonds be made ſtrong. Young men,</hi> be ye not mockers, <hi>leſt your bonds be made strong. Young women,</hi> who are in the flower of your time, mock not, <hi>lest your bonds be made ſtrong.</hi> But now, alace I will there for all this, be a perſon here to day who will be a mocker of this great ſalvation.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The ſixth conſideration to provoke you not to ſlight this great ſalvation any more, is this: Ye know not but that your days may be near, unto a cloſe. I ſay you know not but the day of the preaching of this great ſalvation may be neat unto a cloſe. What knoweſt thou, O man, or woman! but this ſhal be the laſt Sermon that ever thou ſhalt hear concerning this great ſalvation? And yet for all this, ſhall we be ſent away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out one conſent to embrace or receive it? O wil ye
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:178801:82"/> be perſwaded to look to Chriſt, and ſo to take him?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The ſeventh conſideration to provoke you not to ſlight the great ſalvation, is this, That there is a five fold ſalvation comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this great ſalvation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt is this, Come and partake of this great ſalvation, and thou ſhalt have ſalvation from thine idols: And hereby I do proclaim li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty this day unto captives: I am ſent forth this day with the keyes of your priſon houſe, to open your priſon doors unto you, if ye will em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace this great ſalvation. I ſay unto you, <hi>O ye priſoners, come forth and ſhow your ſelves;</hi> for the keyes of your priſon-houſe are with us, to open your priſon-doors unto you; therefore, O come forth, and embrace this great Salvation! Will there be any (ſhal I think) here; that will refuſe to come forth? <hi>O go forth and flee from the land of your captivity, and from the houſe of your bondage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thou ſhalt have ſalvation from thy dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and from thine ignorance. I ſay unto you who underſtand no more of God nor the ſtones of the wall, I command you come forth, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take yet of this great ſalvation, and unto you ſhal light ariſe, even the day-ſpring from on high ſhal viſite you.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If ye will come and partake of this great Salvation, ye ſhal have deliverance from all your fears. Doſt thou fear that thou ſhalt be poor? Come and partake of this great ſalvation, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hou ſhalt be delivered from it. Art thou
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:178801:83"/> afraid of hell? Come and partake of this great Salvation, and thou ſhal be delivered from that fear. Art thou afraid at the wrath of God? Then come, I ſay, and partake of this great Salvation, and thou ſhalt have redemption from that and all thy fears. <hi>With him is plenteous redemption and he can make thee quyet from the fear of evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. If thou wilt come and partake of this Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, thou ſhalt have deliverance from all thine anxieties, and from all thy cares. Ye are now careful and anxious about many things; come, and partake of this great Salvation, and it will make you careful, but only for the one <hi>thing neceſſary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. If ye will come and embrace the great Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation offered unto you this day, ye ſhal be hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped before ye go hence, to ſing that Song, <hi>O death! where is thy ſting? O grave! where is thy victory?</hi> Now, O will ye come and embrace this great Salvation, <hi>And ye ſhal be more then conquerors thorow Chriſt who loveth you?</hi> Are there therefore anie here to day, that would have victorie over the devil, and over their own heart? Then come and embrace this great Salvation and then your victorie is certain.</p>
                  <p>But now to preſs home this great Salvation upon you a little further, there are nine ſorts o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:178801:83"/>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, I invite and call here to day, all who are willing to come and embrace this great ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ntion. Now, are there anie of you here to day, who are called <hi>willing?</hi> Then I invite you to come and embrace this great ſalvation. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. <hi>Whoſoever will, let him come.</hi> But, oh! are there none here to day, who are named willing? I intreat you, if there be anie, do not denie your name, but come when you are called, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace this great Salvation.</p>

                  <p>Fourthly, Chriſt ſometimes manifeſteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, being cloathed with the garments of beauty and raviſhing majeſty ſuch was the ſight that the Spouſe got of Chriſt, <hi>Song</hi> 2.3. <hi>As the Apple-tree amongſt the trees of the wood, ſo is my Beloved amongſt the ſons.</hi> And <hi>Song</hi> 5. when ſhe ſaw him <hi>

                        </gap> and ruddy, and the ſtandard-bearer of ten thouſand.</hi> And ſuch was that joyful ſight of him, when his garments was as the light, and white as the ſnow, which he had at the Transfiguration, when theſe glorified ones did come, as it were, Ambaſſadors from that higher Houſe, to make him a viſit.</p>
                  <p>And fifthly, Chriſt he ſometimes appeareth
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:178801:91"/> to his own in robes of dreadful majeſty, and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble highneſs and loftineſs, when the foul upon the firſt ſight of him remains dead, and there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth no more life in them: ſuch was the ſight <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> got, in the tenth chapter: and ſuch was the ſight that <hi>John</hi> got of Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.17. And I would ask of all that are here, What a ſight have ye gotten of Chriſt to day? In which of all theſe robes have ye ſeen him? It is true, we are not to look to the extraordinary ſights of him; but yet if ever thou haſt ſeen him in any of his wooing robes, ſure he hath appeared matchleſs; and how then ſhal ye then refuſe him?</p>
                  <p>But now to come to the words I was ſpeaking unto you of; The firſt thing in the words; to wit, that there are many who live under the offer of this great Salvation, that do ſlight it, and do not embrace it. And now I ſhall only adde a few things further unto you. 1. Let me propoſe a few conſiderations, to perſwade you to embrace this great Salvation. God forbid we go away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we embrace this Goſpel-ſalvation: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I charge you in his Name, go not away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye embrace it. And to preſs it home upon you, there are theſe eight or nine properties <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> this great Salvation that is offered unto you th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> day.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, it is <hi>a free ſalvation;</hi> ye have n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> more ado but to put forth you hand and take it O! come and take it. Chriſt hath foughten for this Salvation, and there is no more required o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> you, but to come &amp; reap the fruits of his victory
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:178801:91"/> 
                     <hi>Whoever will, let him come;</hi> there is nothing that ſhould move you to ſtay away. <hi>O captives, bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaves to ſatan! O priſoners of hope!</hi> will ye come and partake of the great Salvation? What holds you from coming away, and partaking of it? It is freely offered unto you. Ay, believe it: Chriſt requires no more of you, but that ye ſhould come and take it out of his hand: <hi>If ye conſent to obey,</hi> the bargain is ended; <hi>ye ſhal eat the good of the land,</hi> Iſai. 1.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this great ſalvation is a compleat ſalvation that is offered unto you to day: this is clear, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.71. <hi>That we might be ſaved from our enemies, and from the hands of all that hate us.</hi> There is not an enemy that is in the way; but if thou wilt come and partake of the great ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thou mayeſt have victory over it; ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat a ſalvation is it that is in your offer this day. O! ſhall we paſs away, and not embrace it? O! ſhall our curſed hearts undervalue this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat ſalvation, that is come to our door? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, ſalvation is near unto you, if ye will take it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is a wonderful ſalvation: it is ſuch a ſalvation as the Angels deſire do pry into it: and it is ſuch a ſalvation, that all the Prophets deſired to pry into it. It is almoſt ſix thouſand years, ſince all the Angels of heaven fell into a ſea of wonder at this great ſalvation. It is almoſt ſix thouſand years ſince <hi>Abel</hi> fell into a ſea of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at this great ſalvation. And what think you
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:178801:92"/> is his exerciſe this day? He is even wondering at this great ſalvation. Would ye ask at all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in heaven, would they not all ſay, O! embrace the great ſalvation? Would ye ask all the Saints that are above, would they not adviſe you to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the great ſalvation? Should ye ask at <hi>Adam,</hi> would he not ſay, O! embrace this great ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Could ye ask at <hi>Abel,</hi> would he not ſay, O! embrace the great ſalvation? And would not all the Patriarchs ſay unto you, O! embrace the great ſalvation? And do not all that have taſted of the ſweetneſs of it, cry out unto you, <hi>Come and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the great ſalvation?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth property of this ſalvation is, that it was bought at an exceeding dear rate: it is a dear ſalvation. Would you know the difference between Chriſts coming to this ſalvation, and your coming to it? It is this: Chriſt was forced to travel through all the armies of the Juſtice of God. He was forced to drink of the cup of the wrath of God, before he could come to purchaſe this great Salvation; and now what is required of you to obtain this? We may ſay no more, but put out our hands and take it. Will ye look to the price that was laid down for this Salvation? There is not a wound in the body of Chriſt, but it ſaith, <hi>This is a dear ſalvation.</hi> There is not a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach Chriſt met with, but it ſaith, <hi>O! is not this a dear ſalvation?</hi> There was not a neceſſity that he was put into, but it ſaith, <hi>Is not this a great and dear ſalvation?</hi> O Sirs! will ye not
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:178801:92"/> come and take this great ſalvation, this dear ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? What muſt I give for it, ſay ye? I ſay, ye muſt give nothing for it: come, and take it <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out money, and without price.</hi> It was dear to Chriſt, but it ſhal be cheap unto you. O! is it not cheap unto you? I aſſure you, if ye will come to the market to buy the great ſalvation, there is none of you that needeth to ſtand for the price of it. O! come and take it, and have it, and there ſhall be no more pricing.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, it is an everlaſting ſalvation, that ye ſhal enjoy the fruits of throughout eternity, as is clear, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.13. <hi>He became the author of eternal redemption unto us.</hi> It is a ſalvation that the devil can never be able to get out of your hand: if ye take it, ye ſhal never be robbed of it again. O come, and partake of this great ſalvation, whereby the gates of hell ſhal never prevail againſt you.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, it is a noble and honorable ſalvation: it is not to be taken out of one ſlavery to another, but it is to be taken <hi>out of priſon, that we may reign, Luke</hi> 1.71. compared with <hi>verſe</hi> 74. it is, <hi>That we being ſaved, may ſerve him without fear, in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and righteouſneſs all the days of our life.</hi> I ſay, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ome, come, and partake of this great ſalvation, that your glory may be increaſed, and that ye may be exalted above the Kings of the earth.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, it is a moſt advantageous Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: What are the advantages of any Salvation, that are not to be found in this? Is there not peace to be found through this ſalvation? Is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="180" facs="tcp:178801:93"/> not liberty to be found through this Salvation? Is there not eternal enjoyment of God to be found through this Salvation? Yea, all Salvations are in this one Salvation.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, it is a Royal Salvation, for it cometh to us from and through the Son of God: Chriſt is the Author of it: and we conceive Chriſt may be ſaid to be the Author of this Salvation, in theſe reſpects. 1. He is the meritorious cauſe that did procure it: It was the price of his blood that was laid down for to purchaſe this great Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. 2. He is the fountain from whence it floweth, according to that word which we have cited, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. <hi>He became the Author of eternal ſalvation.</hi> 3. He is the perſon that fitteth out ſpirits for the partaking of it: and it is he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveth mountains out of the way, that we may have fair acceſs unto the great Salvation. 4. It is he that muſt perſwade our hearts to embrace, and to take hold of it. He ſtandeth without, and cryeth to the heart to embrace this great Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and he ſtandeth within, making the heart to cry out: <hi>Content, I will embrace the great ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> He is indeed the perſon that commendeth and doth point forth this great Salvation unto us. He is that noble Miniſter of it. It began firſt to be preached by him.</p>
                  <p>Now is there any of you that have fallen in love with the great Salvation, that ye may try your ſelves? I ſhall give you ſome evidences of the perſons that are near unto this great ſalvation.
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:178801:93"/> 1. Is thine eſtimation of the great Salvation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, be what it was in the morning when thou cameſt hither? Is thine eſtimation of the great Goſpel-ſalvation a foot higher then what it was in the morning? I ſay unto thee, thou art not far from the great ſalvation; come away. 2. Is thy deſire after the great ſalvation increaſed, be what it was in the morning? Haſt thou ſtronger de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires after the great ſalvation, then before thou cameſt hither? That is an evidence thou art not far from it. 3. Is thy thoughts of the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the great ſalvation greater then they were? Thinkeſt thou that thou haſt more need of the great ſalvation, then ever thou thoughteſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? And is thine opinion and thoughts of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thy ſelf, leſs then they were before thou ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt hither? Art thou forced to cry out. <hi>None but Chriſt can ſave me?</hi> I ſay, thou art not far from the great ſalvation: wilt thou come away! O that you would once ſeal this concluſion with much heart-perſwaſion, <hi>I am undone without Christ, I am undone without Christ,</hi> who is the Author of this great ſalvation. Are there any of you that are ſenſible that ye are in the fetters of ſin, and in the bonds of iniquity? Are you brought to the conviction of this, that you are yee in the gall of bitterneſs? I ſay, if thou be brought to this length, to be ſenſible of thy bonds, and art crying out, <hi>O Redeemer? haſten, and come away:</hi> I ſay, If thou be ſenſible of thy bonds and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonments, and crying out; <hi>O thou that waſt
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:178801:94"/> anointed from eternity to proclaim liberty to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptives, and the opening of the priſon to them that are bound!</hi> O haſten, and come away, and redeem me, even <hi>poor me,</hi> ſinking, ſinning, periſhing, ſelf-deſtroying <hi>me?</hi> thou art not far from the great ſalvation. 4. Art thou a perſon who beginneth to weep, becauſe thou haſt been ſo long a ſtranger to Chriſt, and the great ſalvation? Old men that are here, How long have you been ſtrangers to the great ſalvation, and to the Author of it? Now will you ſhed one tear for your eſtrangement; and cry out; <hi>Wo is me, that Chriſt and I have been ſo long aſunder.</hi> I ſay, if thou haſt come that length, thou art not far from the great ſalvation: <hi>Come away.</hi> O pity yourſelves: make haſte, make haſte, and <hi>come away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now in the third place, let me give you ſome evidences, by which you may know more clearly, whether or no you have embraced this great ſalvation, that you may know your ſelves, and that you walk not down to your grave with a lye in your right hand.</p>
                  <p>The firſt evidence of a perſon that hath em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the great ſalvation, is, that he will have an high eſteem of the Savior and Author of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> is a ſpeaking evidence unto thee, thou art a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the great ſalvation. Art thou come <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> this length, that thou crieſt out: <hi>None but Chriſt none but Chriſt;</hi> it is a ſpeaking evidence, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="183" facs="tcp:178801:94"/> thou art come to be a partaker of the great ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when thou canſt cry out that word, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.3. <hi>The Lord is my ſtrength and my ſong, he alone is become my ſalvation.</hi> If Chriſt hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thy ſalvation, then it is like he hath become thy long. I would ask this of you, Were you ever brought this length, that you durſt not adventure to praiſe Chriſt alone, but was forced to call in all the creatures, and ſay: <hi>O magnify the Lord with me?</hi> O that is an evidence that you have embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, thoſe who have embraced the great ſalvation, will ſtudy to maintain and keep their grips of it; they will ſtudy to hold faſt ſo precious a jewel: this is preſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Stand faſt in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free:</hi> Yea, they will ſtudy to walk ſutably to this noble mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; at leaſt, they will ſtrive and endeavor to do it, as is alſo preſt in that ſame verſe. I ſay, if thou haſt been made a partaker of the Goſpel of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, thou wilt ſtrive to keep thy ſelf from the power of thoſe things that once triumphed over thee.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, a perſon that is a partaker of the great ſalvation, he will have a high eſteem of this mercy and ſalvation: So <hi>Paul,</hi> when he ſpeaketh of it here, he cannot but put ſome note of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency to it, calling it, <hi>the great Salvation;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I ſay, if thou haſt embraced the great ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thou wilt have ſo high eſteem of it, that not to be ſo ſubjected to it as thou ſhouldeſt, or
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:178801:95"/> to be in ſubjection to the power of thy luſt in any meaſure, will be thy burden and affliction: The man will be ſory when he is brought forth from the Houſe of his bondage unto the red Sea: He will be ſory, that when he ſhould have ſongs of triumph over his idols put in his mouth, that they ſhould ſing ſongs of triumph over him.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, a perſon that hath embraced the great Salvation, he will be longing ſometimes for the day when this Salvation ſhall be compleat, when he ſhall ſing that ſong with <hi>that numerous multitude which cannot be numbred,</hi> Revel. 7.9. O what a day ſhall it be, when thou ſhalt begin to ſing that ſong? <hi>After this,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I beheld, and lo a great multitude of all people which no man could number, of all people, nations and languages, ſtood before the Throne, and before the Lamb, cloathed with white robes, and palms in their hands, and they cryed:</hi> And how cryed they? <hi>They cryed with a loud voice.</hi> They would not mutter the ſong, not ſing ſilently; but <hi>cryed with a loud voice:</hi> And what did they cry? They cryed with a loud voice, <hi>ſalvation unto our God who ſitteth upon the Throne and to the Lamb.</hi> I would only ask of you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

Yea, what a day ſhal it be, when thou ſhalt be cloathed with theſe excellent garments that are made mention of, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 6.10. ſo he hath cloathed thee with <hi>the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſalvation;</hi> and he hath covered thee with <hi>the robe of righteouſneſs.</hi> O what robes are theſe! Did you ever ſee ſuch excellent robes as theſe muſt be? I think, we will misken our ſelves. O do you not think, we will misken our ſelves, when we ſhal put on theſe excellent robes! Now therefore is the bargain cloſed, or will ye go away before ye take this great ſalvation? Dare ye go out at theſe doors, and neglect the great Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? I would ask this of you, think ye it will not be moſt ſad, that Chriſt ſhould tell this in Heaven of you to night; I was preached to a pack of ſtones; that none of them would love me? Will ye not be feared that this report ſhall be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried back to Heaven of you? For what report can Chriſt carry back but this? Now is the cord of this great ſalvation let down unto you: is there none of you that will take a grip of it? Will ye flighter after it: Will ye make this a rejoycing day in Heaven, that is a faſting day unto you: and the way to make it ſo, is, to embrace the great ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Now what ſay ye to it, old men? Let me ſpeak to you, and ask your thoughts of the great ſalvation, Gray hairs ſhould be a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteouſneſs, Old men, ſpeak your minds, that young men may not have your bad examples: What ſay ye of this ſalvation? Is it not a moſt glorious ſalvation?
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:178801:96"/> Is it not a moſt excellent ſalvation that is in your offer? I intreat you, ſpeak your minds: tell Chriſt ye are content to take the great ſalvation; otherwiſe, whoever he be that will not partake of this Goſpel-Salvation, I in the Name and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Chriſt our Maſter, denounce eternal and irrevocable war againſt him: Put on your harneſs, ye ſhal not boaſt when ye put it off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: The wrath and fury of God ſhal come upon you to the uttermoſt, if ye embrace not this great ſalvation. Other wars are but for a time: the greateſt Captains that ever the earth did carry; are now laid <hi>down in the ſides of the pit, and their ſwords broken under their head.</hi> Armies of ten hundred thouſand, an hundred years time have laid them all in their graves, and ended all their conteſts; but there is no diſcharge of this war that ſhal be concluded betwixt Chriſt and you: It ſhal become an eternal and moſt terrible war, which ſhal be but beginning when time is ended. Now peace or war, which of them will ye chooſe? Dare ye ſend a charge to Chriſt, and ſay, Ye will defie him? I am afraid there will be two things that many of us will report to day. Firſt, I am afraid there be many that will give <hi>Pharaohs</hi> report to the offer of the great ſalvation, and ſay: <hi>Who is the Lord that I ſhould obey him?</hi> I tell you who he is, <hi>He is glorious in holineſs, fearfull in praiſes, doing wonders.</hi> O embrace him before he go hence, and give not <hi>Pharaohs</hi> report, leſt ye be drowned in the ſea of his wrath, whence there ſhall be no recovery. Secondly,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:178801:96"/> I fear there will be many here to day, that will give <hi>Demas</hi> report to his precious offer: I will go and forſake Chriſt, and embrace this preſent World. O bad exchange! Curſed be he that ſhall make it: will ye be of <hi>Demas</hi> humor. I fear there hath been many of that humor of a long time: but, I intreat you, once be wiſe before you dye. I confeſs that Proverb, <hi>Old fools, are twice fools.</hi> I think, old men that will not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the great ſalvation, I think ye are triple fools. What wait ye for? Is there any thing can afford you any ſatisfaction but this great ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? Now are ye convinced, old men, that Chriſt is waiting for your anſwer. I intreat you, before ye go hence, ſpeak your minds what ye think of the great Salvation. Is it not a lovely Salvation? Is it not lovely now? What ſay ye to it? I am to go away, and the offer is to be taken up at this time; and it is hard to ſay, if ever ye ſhal have an offer again. I would only ſay this to you, and be ſure of it; though I ſhould never be a partaker of this great ſalvation, yet I ſhal be a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt you that are not partakers of it. I tell and declare unto you, I ſhal be a witneſs againſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Now, if ye will give no more, give this, will ye go home and think upon it? I ſhall not be uncharitable, nor enter to judge your thoughts. I fear there ſhal be

But I ſay unto you, when your deſires of death are not accompanied with deſires of Heaven, ſuſpect them. I would ſay this, that there are ſome who will have ten deſires for death, when they will not have one for the death of the body of death: But it were good for thee who art ſuch, to be deſiring the death of the body of death, then ſhouldeſt thou be in a more ſuteable frame to deſire to dye. 3. Some will have hearty deſires to dye, and yet when death cometh they will be as unwilling to dye as any: It hath been obſerved, that ſome who have much deſired to dye, when death came, have cryed out, <hi>O ſpare a little that I may recover ſtrength, &amp;c.</hi> There is a great difference between a deſire to dye, and death it ſelf. It is an eaſy thing to deſire to dye, but it is a very great buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to meet with death, and to look it in the face when it cometh. We think death ere it come near to us, to be but childrens play, but when we meet with it, it maketh us change our thoughts: for it is a great buſineſs to dye.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> In ſome caſes is it lawful for a Chriſtian to deſire to live, even when he is ſummoned to dye; which is clear from the practiſe of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 39.13. where he prayeth <hi>that the Lord will ſpare him a little:</hi> it is alſo clear from the practiſe of good <hi>Hezekiah, Iſai.</hi> 38.3. when he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>to ſet his houſe in order: for he ſhould dye, and not live;</hi> he cryed forth, <hi>Remember now, O Lord, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which was good in thy ſight; and Hezekiah wept ſore.</hi> Or as the word is in the Original, <hi>he wept with great wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping:</hi> but to guard this, take theſe two <hi>Cautions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>Caution</hi> 1. Thy deſires to live (when thou art ſummoned to dye) ſhould not be peremptory, but with ſubmiſſion to the will of God, that if it be his pleaſure to remove thee preſently out of time, thou ſhouldſt be content to dye.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>Caution</hi> 2. Thy deſires to live ſhould have gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious principles, and alſo a very gracious end, as is moſt clear from <hi>David, Pſalm</hi> 39.13. where he ſaith, <hi>O ſpare me a little that I may recover my ſtrength, before I go from hence, and be no more:</hi> his deſire to live, was that he might have victory over his Idols; as if he had ſaid, my deſire to live, is, that I may have ſtrength to wreſtle with, and overcome my idols: and without all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> deſire was a moſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and well-grounded deſire: However, I would ſay this unto thee, that thou ſhouldeſt
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:178801:101"/> examine thy deſires to live, as much (if not more) as thy deſires to dye; for we are ready to ſhun death, if we could; but he is that univerſal King, unto whom all of us muſt be ſubject ere long.</p>
                  <p>Now in the words that are read unto you, there are theſe ſix things which may be clearly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that it is a moſt true and infallible truth, that all perſons ſhal once ſee death; as is clear in theſe words: <hi>VVho is he that liveth, and ſhal not ſee death?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, that this truth, that we ſhal once ſee death, is not much believed, or thought upon by many; therefore it is that the Pſalmiſt doubleth the aſſertion: <hi>VVho is he that liveth, and ſhal not ſee death? Shal he deliver his ſoul</hi> (that is, his life) <hi>from the hand</hi> (that is) <hi>from the power of the Grave?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that ſometimes a Chriſtian may win to the ſolid Faith of this truth, that once he muſt dye; this the Pſalmiſt wan unto, as it is alſo clear in that word (who) <hi>VVho is he that liveth, and ſhal not ſee death?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that the certainty of this, that once we ſhal dye, ſhould be kept in our mind; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that note of attention, <hi>Selah,</hi> is put to it, as if he had ſaid, Take heed that there is none living that ſhal not dye.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, that howbeit ſome perſons put the evil day far away, as if they were not to ſee death; yet is the day coming when they ſhall ſee death,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:178801:101"/> and death ſhal take them by the hand.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, we ſhal take notice of this from the context, that the Chriſtian who is much in min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the brevity of his life, will believe the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of his death. The Pſalmiſt was ſpeaking of the ſhortneſs of his life in the preceeding verſe, and in this verſe he ſpeaketh of the certainty of death.</p>
                  <p>Now as for the firſt of theſe things obſerved, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is certain and moſt ſure, that we muſt all once dye: I hope there are none of you here who will deny it, although I confeſs ſome few of you believe it: yet ſaid the woman of <hi>Tekoah,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. <hi>VVe muſt all dye, and be like water ſpilt upon the ground, that cannot be gathered up again; and God doth not accept the perſon of any.</hi> And <hi>Job</hi> 30.13. <hi>I know thou wilt bring me to death, and to the houſe appointed for all living.</hi> And it is very clear, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8.8. <hi>There is no man that hath power over the ſpirit to retain the ſpirit, neither hath he any power in the day of death; and there is no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge in that war, neither ſhal wickedneſs deliver thoſe that are given to it.</hi> It is alſo clear, <hi>Heb</hi> 9.27. <hi>It is appointed unto all men once to die.</hi> So it is moſt clear that we muſt dye. I remember of one <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> who had one ſubſtitute for this very end, to cry at his chamber-door every morning, <hi>Memento mori, memento mori, momento mori:</hi> Remember thou art to dye. And it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to have been the practiſe of the Nobles of <hi>Greece,</hi> that in the day wherein their Emperor was crowned, that they preſented a <hi>marble ſton<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                     </hi>
                     <pb n="189" facs="tcp:178801:102"/> unto him, and he was enquired after what faſhion he would have his Tomb-ſtone made? Which practiſe ſpeak this unto us, that although theſe were moſt deſtitute of the light of the Scriptures, they were very mindful of death. Believe me, death may ſurpriſe us before we be aware: for it is moſt certain that we muſt dye; but there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more uncertain then the way how, and the time when we ſhal dye.</p>
                  <p>Death will ſurpriſe ſome, as it did <hi>Abel,</hi> in the open field, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.8. Death will ſurpriſe ſome, as it did <hi>Eglon,</hi> in his parlour, <hi>Judges</hi> 3.21. And death will ſurpriſe ſome, as it did <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> in the flight, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 31.</p>
                  <p>Now in ſpeaking unto this point, I ſhal firſt ſpeak a little to thoſe advantages which attend thoſe that live within continual fight of death. Secondly, I ſhal give you ſome conſiderations to preſs you to prepare for death. Thirdly, I ſhal give you ſome directions to help you to prepare for death. And then we ſhal proceed unto the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond point of doctrine which we obſerved from the Text, and ſhal ſpeak a few things from it unto you, and ſo come to a cloſe for this time.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, we conceive there are theſe ſeven ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which attend thoſe who live within the continual ſight of this truth, that they muſt dye.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the faith of approaching death, will make a ſoul exceeding diligent in duty: This was our bleſſed Lords Divinity, <hi>John</hi> 9.4. <hi>I muſt work the work of him that ſent me, while it is day: the night <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, death is
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:178801:102"/> approaching, therefore I muſt work. It is clear alſo, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. compared with <hi>verſe</hi> 14. In the 12. <hi>verſe, Peter</hi> is exceeding diligent in his duty, and the ground of his diligence is in the 14. <hi>verſe: Knowing that ſhortly I muſt put off this my taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,</hi> &amp;c. Yea, it is even the <hi>Epicures</hi> argument, <hi>Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we ſhal dye.</hi> And ſhould not the Chriſtian much more cry out, <hi>Let me watch, and pray, for to morrow I may dye.</hi> I ſay, if the <hi>Epicures</hi> did make uſe of that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to make them vigorous in the purſuit of their pleaſures; O how much more ſhould a Chriſtian improve it, for making him vigorous in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of his duty? Therefore, I ſay unto you all, O! be diligent, for your night is drawing near. O Chriſtians, and expectants of heaven, are you not afraid leſt you be nighted before you have walked the half of your journey? For if you be nighted on your journey to Heaven, before you come to the end of your race, there is no retiring place whereunto you may turn aſide to lodge; therefore, <hi>O work, work, work, while it is day;</hi> for behold death is approaching, and then ſhal we all be called to an account.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The faith of approaching death will make a Chriſtian exceeding active in his duty: he will not only be diligent, but alſo exceeding ſerious and zealous in the exerciſe of his duty: This is clear from that notable exhortation, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.10. <hi>Whatſoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might:</hi> and the reaſon is, <hi>for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wiſdom in the grave
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:178801:103"/> whither thou goest.</hi> Wherefore, O be active while you are alive; for you ſhal never work any more after you are dead: and if ye leave but one work undone, there is no doing of it after death: <hi>There is no work,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, in the grave,</hi> therefore, O be active.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The faith of this truth, <hi>that we muſt all dye,</hi> will help a Chriſtian to be exceeding mortified to the things of a preſent World. Oh, covetous men and women! would you ſhake hands with cold Death but once every morning, I ſhould defie you to purſue the World ſo much as you do. <hi>Paul</hi> was much in the meditation of his change, which made him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.18. to overlook thoſe things that are temporary: <hi>VVhile we look not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to the things that are ſeen, which are temporal; but to the things which are not ſeen, which are eternal.</hi> Therefore chap. 5.1. <hi>Knowing that if our earthly houſe of this tabernacle were diſſolved, we have a building of God, an Houſe not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens; therefore in this we groan earnestly, deſiring to be cloathed upon with our houſe which is from Heaven.</hi> What aileth you, <hi>Paul,</hi> might one have laid, may you not take a look of the World? No, ſaith he, <hi>for</hi> I <hi>know that if this earthly houſe of this tabernacle were diſſolved, I have a houſe with God, not made with hands, but eternal in the Heavens.</hi> That is, I know that ere long the pins of my Tabernacle will be looſed, and it will fall down about my ears, therefore I muſt look for another dwelling houſe. And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.24. <hi>The faſhion of this world paſſeth away;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:178801:103"/> ſaith he, verſe 32. <hi>I would have you without carefulneſs, caring to pleaſe the Lord.</hi> And Phil. 4.2. <hi>Let your moderation be known to all men; the Lord is at hand.</hi> As if he had ſaid, death is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, and at hand; therefore, I intreat you, be ſober. But I think many of us will be found, like <hi>Saul</hi> hid amongſt the ſtuff; that is, we will be lying amongſt the midſt of the pleaſures of this paſſing World. But I ſay to thee who art ſuch an one, that death will break the ſtrings of thy harp, and thy muſick will quickly ceaſe. O! but death will make thee have a low eſteem of the World. O! bleſſed is the perſon who hath thoſe thoughts of the World all along his way, which he ſhal have of it at his death! Have not the moſt curſed wretches been forced to cry out: <hi>Oh! I would give ten thouſand worlds for Chriſt?</hi> Have not ſome perſons (who have had the Moon upon their head, and that have made their belly their God) being forced to cry forth at death: <hi>O curſed perſon that I am, that ever I made the world my God!</hi> Alace, that I contented my ſelf with the World! Therefore, I ſay unto thee who art ſuch an one, O! ſtay thy purſuit after the World, for death is approaching, that will cauſe all thy world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comforts to evaniſh.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When a Chriſtian believeth this truth, that he muſt dye, it will be an exceeding great reſtraint to keep him from ſinning, as is clear, <hi>Job</hi> 31.13. compared with <hi>verſe</hi> 14. where <hi>Job</hi> reckoning over many good deeds done by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:178801:104"/> ſaith: <hi>What then ſhal I do, when God riſeth up? And when he viſiteth, what ſhal I anſwer him?</hi> As if he had ſaid, Sirs, miſtake me not, I am not boaſting much of my ſelf, for I could not have done otherwiſe; elſe what ſhould I do when God riſeth up: How could I anſwer to God, if I had done otherwiſe? I think it were a notable pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe for each of you, when temptations begin to aſſault you, to ſay: <hi>O temptation! what ſhal I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to God when he riſeth up to reprove me, if I ſhould yeeld unto thee.</hi> Likewiſe <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11.9. where <hi>Solomon</hi> diſſwading young men to purſue after va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, bringeth this as a reaſon: <hi>Know thou, that for all theſe things, God will bring thee to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi> Therefore, I ſay unto thee who art often tempted to ſin, let death and reckoning with God be ſtill in thy ſight, and I defie thee then to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace half ſo many temptations as now thou doſt. I intreat you, to anſwer all your temptations with that one word: <hi>What ſhal I do, when he riſeth up? And what ſhal I anſwer, when he viſiteth me?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. When a Chriſtian liveth within the ſight of this truth, that he ſhal once ſee death, it ſhal make him exceeding patient under every croſs wherewith he meets: Such a Chriſtian will hardly meet with a croſs, but he will quiet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with this; Death will put me beyond this croſs: This is but a cloud that will quickly paſs away. And for this cauſe did <hi>David</hi> ſo compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly put up that deſire, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 39.4. <hi>Lord, make me to know mine end, and the meaſure of my days.</hi> He was ſure that the knowledge of his end
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:178801:104"/> would put him in a ſober and patient frame.</p>
                  <p>The ſixth advantage is this, The faith of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching death, will teach the perſon that hath it, to ſtudy ſaving wiſdom; this is clear <hi>Pſalm</hi> 90.12. where <hi>David</hi> putteth up this requeſt: <hi>So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wiſdom.</hi> As if he had ſaid, I will never think my ſelf wiſe, till I know that bleſſed piece of A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ithmetick, <hi>How to number my days.</hi> I would deſire every one of you all, to think with your ſelves every morning when you ariſe. Now we are an hour nearer unto eternity then we were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: and at the end of every hour, Now we are a day nearer unto eternity, then we were before. I ſay, think often, yea always thus, We were never ſo near death as we are now; for oh! are we not all nearer to eternity to day, then we were ye ſterday?</p>
                  <p>The ſeventh advantage attending the faith of approaching death, is this, That it will make a Chriſtian very careful in preparing for death: it is impoſſible for one to believe really that death is approaching, and not prepare for it. Say what you will, if you be not careful in preparing for death, you have not the ſolide faith of this truth, that you ſhal dye. Believe me, it is not every one that thinketh he believeth this truth, that believeth it indeed. And, O how dreadful is it for an unprepared man to meet with death? He deſireth not to dye; yea, he would give a World for his life; but dye he muſt, whether he will
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:178801:105"/> or not; for death will not be requeſted to ſpare a little when he cometh: and therefore, I ſay unto you: <hi>Set your houſe in order, for you ſhal ſurely dye.</hi> Old men and women, <hi>Set your houſe in order, for ſurely ye muſt dye.</hi> Young men and women, <hi>Set your houſe in order, for to morrow ye may dye, and be cut off in the flower of your age.</hi> Think not that there are any who can ſell time: for I ſay, you ſhal never get time ſold unto you. Alace! I feat the moſt part of perſons that dye now, death fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them at unawares: for indeed the perſons that dye amongſt us, when we come to viſite them, we may give you a full account of them; for we think they are all comprehended under theſe four ſorts.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, when we go to viſite ſome perſons on their death bed, they are like unto <hi>Nabal, their heart is dying and ſinking, like unto a ſtone within them:</hi> they are no more affected with death, then if it were a fancy. Alace, for the great ſtupidity that hath overtaken many! Therefore, I intreat you, delay not your repentance till death, leſt the Lord take away your wit, ſo that you cannot then repent, for your ſenſleſneſs and ſtupide frame of ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond ſort we find in a preſumptuous frame, ſaying, They have had a good hope all their days, and they will not quite it now: they will go down to the grave with their hope in their right hand, or rather they will go down to the grave <hi>with a lye in their right hand:</hi> they live in a perſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:178801:105"/> frame, and they dye in the ſame deluſion: for when we tell them that by all probability they are going down to hell: they anſwer, God forbid! I was all my time a very honeſt man, or woman. But I love not that confeſſion; for there are many ſuch honeſt men and women in hell this day.</p>
                  <p>The third ſort we find have ſome convictions, that they have been playing the fool all their days; but we can get them no further: I ſhal only ſay to ſuch, To go down to the Grave with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions in their breaſt, not making uſe of Chriſt, is to go down to hell with a candle in their hand, to let them ſee the way: and truly the greater part that dye, dye in this manner.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, there are ſome whom we find in a ſelf-righteous frame, truſting upon the covenant of works, and their own merits, and truſting by theſe to go to heaven; yet neglecting the offer of Chriſts righteouſneſs: But, alace! we find not one of a thouſand in this frame, <hi>I deſire to be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt, that is beſt of all.</hi> And ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do we find any in ſuch a frame, <hi>O wretched man that I am! who ſhal deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> Therefore I ſay unto you who are all here; O will you mind death before it take hold on you! Oh, mind your work now! for you will find that death ſhal be work enough for it ſelf, though you leave no work till then.</p>
                  <p>The eighth advantage that attendeth the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian believing this truth, that once he muſt dye, is this; Death will not be ſo terrible to him; as it
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:178801:106"/> is to many when it cometh. What think you, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth death <hi>a King of terrors?</hi> What maketh many to ſhake like the leaf of a tree, when they are ſummoned to appear before Gods Tribunal? It is even becauſe of this, they have not been thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on death before it came, ſo as to prepare for it: and I fear many in this place may be feared for death; and that when it cometh to them, they will ſay unto death, as <hi>Achab</hi> ſaid to <hi>Elijah, Haſt thou found me, O mine enemy!</hi> Surely, death will take you, and bring you to the Judgement-ſeat of Chriſt: therefore ſtudy by all means to think of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren upon it, and make ready for it; for, believe me, death is a very big word; for it will once make you ſtand with horror in your ſouls, if your peace be not made up with God. I know not a more dreadful diſpenſation, then death and a guilty conſcience meeting together.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing that I ſhal ſpeak unto from the firſt obſervation, <hi>viz. That it is a most certain and infallible truth, that all perſons ſhal once ſee death,</hi> ſhal be to give ſome good conſiderations for preſſing you to prepare for death.</p>
                  <p>The firſt conſideration is this, that to <hi>dye well, and in the Lord,</hi> is a moſt difficult work; therefore I intreat you, prepare for death. It is a difficult work to communicate aright: it is a difficult work to pray aright; and it is a difficult work to confer aright. But I muſt tell you, it is a more difficult work to dye aright, then any of theſe: it is true, it is more difficult to communicate aright, then to
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:178801:106"/> pray aright; yet it is much more difficult to dye aright, then to communicate aright; for it is a moſt difficult work to dye in the Lord. Death will put the moſt accurate Chriſtian that is here to a wonderful ſearch; and therefore I will tell you nine things that death will try in thee. 1. Death will try both the reality and ſtrength of thy faith; it may be eaſy for thee to keep up faith under many difficulties, but death ſhal put thy faith to the greateſt ſtreſs that ever it did meet with. Yea, know this, that the faith of the ſtrongeſt believer may get, and ordinarily doth get, a ſet at death, the like whereof it never got before; therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for death. 2. Death will try thy love to God; ſome perſons pretend much love to him, but death will propoſe this queſtion to ſuch a perſon, <hi>Loveſt thou him more then theſe? Loveſt thou him more then thy wife? More then thy houſe? More then thy friends?</hi> But your unwillingneſs to dye, giveth us much ground to fear that many have little love to Chriſt, but much to the World, and ſo dare not anſwer the queſtion, <hi>Lord, thou knoweſt that I love thee.</hi> 3. Death will try thy enjoyments; ſome of you may be ready to think that you meet with many enjoyments, ſo that you might reckon, as you think, to fourty enjoyments, and ſweet out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lettings; but beware that death bring them not down to twenty. I have known ſome who thought they had met fourty times with God; but when death came, it made them take down the count to the half: therefore ſeeing death will try the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:178801:107"/> reality of thine enjoyments, O prepare for it. 4. Death will try thy patience: thou mayeſt ſeem to have much patience now, but when death co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth (thou art put to dye) it will put thy patience to a great tryal; therefore prepare for it. 5. Death will try the reality of thy duties, yea, even thoſe duties wherein thou hadſt moſt ſatisfaction, as thy communicating aright in ſuch a place, thou hopeſt that is ſure; thy reading the Scripture at ſuch a time aright, thou hopeſt that is ſure; thou prayedſt at ſuch a time aright, and hopeſt that is ſure, thou meditateſt in ſuch a place aright, and thou hopeſt that is ſure. But, believe me, death may make thee change thy thoughts: for there are ſome perſons who have communicated and prayed, &amp;c. as right as any in this genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who, for all that, will not find ſix duties wherein they can find ſatisfaction at death. 6. Death will exceedingly try thy ſincerity when it cometh: An hypocrite may go all along his whole way undiſcovered, yet death may bring him to light, and make it appear what a man he is. 7. Death will diſcover unto thee hid and ſecret ſins, of which thou never had a thought before; yea, albeit thou thoughteſt theſe had been forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, death will let thee ſee them ſtanding between thee and the light of his countenance. 8. Death will accurately try thy mortification: Some think they have come a great length in mortification; but, believe me, death will try it, and put it to the touch-ſtone. 9. Death will try thy hope whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:178801:107"/> it be real or not. I ſhal only ſay this, that all the other graces muſt low their ſails to faith, and ſo it is, faith muſt carry us thorow, being that laſt triumphing grace which muſt fit the field for us, when all the other graces will faint and ly by. It is faith that muſt enter us fairly within the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of eternity. It is faith muſt gainſtand all the temptations of death; yea, all the other graces, as it were, ſtand by, and ſee faith ſtrike the laſt ſtroke in this war.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond conſideration to preſs you to mind death, is this: That ye are to dye but once. O! labor to do that well which you are to do but once, and the wrong doing of which can never be helped: If ye pray not aright, ye may get that mended; and if ye communicate not aright, ye may get that alſo mended: but, alace! if ye dye not aright, there is no mending of that: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, O prepare for death, that ye may dye well, ſeeing ye are to dye but once.</p>
                  <p>The third conſideration to preſs you to mind death, is this: That ye are pronounced bleſſed who dye in the Lord, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.13. <hi>Bleſſed are the dead which dye in the Lord.</hi> O let that provoke you to prepare for death, that ſo ye may dye in the Lord, that is the only way to make you eternally happy. I confeſs, it is a queſtion difficult to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, whether it be more difficult to dye well, or to live well? I ſhal not anſwer it, but rather deſire you to ſtudy both.</p>
                  <p>The fourth conſideration to preſs you to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for death, is this; <hi>viz.</hi> That though thou
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:178801:108"/> put all thy work by thy hand before death, ye ſhalt thou find that death ſhal have work enough for it ſelf, yea as much as thou ſhalt get done. It will then be much for thee to win to patience, it will be much for thee to win to the ſight of thy juſtification, and it will then be much for thee to win to aſſurance: O then, is it not needful for thee to put all thy work by thy hand before thy latter end come? Wherefore I may ſay to you, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid in his Song, <hi>Deuter.</hi> 32.29. <hi>O that they were wiſe, that they understood this, that they would conſider their latter end!</hi> O that ye had this piece of divine wiſdom! I pray you, conſider that ſad word, <hi>Lam</hi> 1.19. <hi>She remembered not her laſt end:</hi> and what of it? <hi>Therefore ſhe came down wonderfully.</hi> So will the down-coming of many in this generation be wonderful, who conſider not their laſt end.</p>
                  <p>The fifth conſideration for preſſing you to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for death, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That their labor ſhal end, but their works ſhal not be forgotten, as is clear from that fore-cited place, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.13. <hi>They rest from their labors, and their works follow them;</hi> and is not that a glorious advantage?</p>
                  <p>The ſixth conſideration to preſs you to prepare for death, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That death may come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you ere ye be aware: ye know not but death may ſurpriſe you this night, before ye go home to your houſes: and therefore let that preſs you to ſtudy a conſtant preparation for death.</p>
                  <p>The ſeventh conſideration to preſs you to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for death, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That as death leaveth
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:178801:108"/> you, ſo will Judgement find you: If death ſhal leave you ſtrangers to Chriſt, ye ſhal appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Judgement-ſeat ſtrangers unto him, therefore, I intreat you all, to prepare for it. I think that noble practiſe of <hi>Paul,</hi> exceeding wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of imitation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.31. <hi>I dye daily,</hi> which I think doth comprehend theſe three things. 1. That <hi>Paul</hi> had death always in his ſight. 2. It comprehendeth this, that he labored to keep ſuch a frame as that every moment he ſhould be ready to dye, ſo that whenſoever death ſhould put the ſummonds in his hand, he ſhould be content to anſwer. 3. It comprehendeth this, that he labored to lay aſide and remove all things out of the way, that might detain him from laying down his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle. O ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> I labor ſo to clear my ſelf of all hinderances, as that when ever I ſhal be ſummoned to remove out of time, I may willingly lay down my life. Therefore I would ask you this queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> When did you make your laſt te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament? I think it were ſuitable for us to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing our latter-will every day, for in ſo doing, <hi>Paul</hi> made an excellent teſtament, the better of which none that died ſince have made, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7.8. <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith;</hi> theſe are very ſweet articles: and then he addeth, <hi>Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteouſneſs, that the Lord the righteous Judge ſhal give me at that day.</hi> And think ye not that very ſweet that he would leave ſomething unto you in Chriſts Name? <hi>viz. And not for me only, but for all them that
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:178801:109"/> wait for his appearance.</hi> Now I come to the third thing propoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> To give ſome directions for helping you to prepare for death.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>Direct.</hi> 1. I intreat you, be much in prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for death every day: for it is even a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for heaven, to be taking a fight of your grave and latter end every day.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>Direct.</hi> 2. I intreat you, be much in theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Firſt, in ſelf-examination, that your comp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> may be clear with God; for many a ragged compt ſhal we have when death and we ſhal meet. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, be much in the exerciſe of repentance, that ſo ye may have every fault and corruption in you mourned for, before death and you meet. Thirdly, be much in the exerciſe of faith, <hi>making your calling and election ſure.</hi> Fourthly, be much in the exerciſe of mortification, and that will help you to keep a looſe grip, not only of the World, but alſo of your other idols: and if ye be much in theſe, ye ſhall undoubtedly be prepared for death.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>Direct.</hi> 3. Be much in minding the excellent things of heaven: a Chriſtian that would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for death, ſhould have all his thoughts and converſation there. I think it would be an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent help, in preparation for death, to take a ſight of the crown every day.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <hi>Direct.</hi> 4. Labor always to keep a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, void of offence toward God and man. I ſay, labor to keep thy conſcience clear, and that ſhal be a continual feaſt unto thee.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <hi>Direct.</hi> 5. Slight not any known duty, do not
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:178801:109"/> crucify any conviction, neither break any reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: put theſe three together, and that will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly help you to prepare for death: I ſay, ſee that ye adventure not to ſlight any known duty: ſee that ye adventure not to crucify any convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: and ſee that ye adventure not to break your reſolutions.</p>
                  <p>Now we come to the ſecond thing which we obſerved from the words, <hi>viz.</hi> That this truth, that we ſhal once ſee death, is not much believed by many of us: and to make this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, we ſhal only give ſome evidences unto you, to prove that we are not as yet prepared for death.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Evidence.</hi> Doth not the unſpeakable ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity that hath overtaken many, ſay, that we are not people prepared for death? Alace! many of us would find our ſelves in a moſt ſtupid temper, if we were preſently to dye: for many of us are no more moved with the threatnings and terrors of God, then if they did not belong unto us: and this ſaith, We are not as yet prepared for death.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Evid.</hi> That we are not prepared for death, in our purſuing ſo much after the vain and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing delights of a preſent World. Many of us <hi>riſe up early, and go to bed late at night, and eat the bread of ſorrow all the day, and load themſelves with thick clay.</hi> And I am ſure, that ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (being night and day taken up with the World) is not prepared for death. I remember a word recorded of ſuch a wretched one who was
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:178801:110"/> exceeding rich; ſaid he, I would give ſo many thouſands of money, if death would but give m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> one day; yet he got it not. And, O how ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly will death ſurpriſe many of you, as it did him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Evid.</hi> Which ſpeaketh forth our unprepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redneſs for death, is our impatience under every petty croſs that we meet with: for the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Chriſtian will be patient under very ſharp croſſes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Evid.</hi> That we are not prepared, is our not endeavouring to live within ſight of our intereſt in God: Oh, if we were prepared for death, durſt we live in ſo much incertainty of our intereſt in God, and of our aſſurance of heaven!</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Evid.</hi> Some of us can let our idols lye in our breaſt ſix years without repentance, and will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſtudy to mortify them, nor repent for them; and ſurely ſuch are not prepared for death.</p>
                  <p>Now I intreat you ſeriouſly, to mind what hath been ſaid, and that ye may the more ſeriouſly think upon it, I will tell you ſome material challenges, that your conſcience at death will preſent unto you; therefore take heed that ye may know how ye will anſwer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Challenge,</hi> Is the ſlighting of much precious time, and ſinning away the precious offers of grace. O what will ye anſwer to that challenge when death ſhal preſent it to you! Death will ſay (or rather thine own conſcience at death) what ailed thee to ſin ſo many hours, without either praying, reading, or meditating? Now
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:178801:110"/> have ye any thing to anſwer when death ſhal preſent this challenge to you? I intreat you, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditate what ye will ſay: I intreat you, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent death by preſenting it firſt ſeriouſly to your ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Challenge.</hi> That death will preſent unto you, will be for the killing of many precious convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which ye have had. What will each of you anſwer at death, when your conſcience propoſeth this challenge unto you? Thou metſt with ſuch a challenge at ſuch a time, and went home and crucified it. And at another time thou metſt with another challenge, and went home and crucified it. Theſe challenges will be laid home to thy door, therefore think on them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Challenge.</hi> Death will charge you for a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal hypocritical way of going about duties: I ſay your conſcience will then tell you, that ye went to ſuch a communion with a ſelfiſh end; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Believe me, there was never an offer of this everlaſting Goſpel, and of Chriſt in it, made unto you, that ſhal not at death (before or after it) be brought to your remembrance. And, O how ſad and doleful will it be to you, when Chriſt ſhal open the Book where your ſins are written, and begin with the ſin of ſlighting the great Salvation! Thus I invited you, when you were twelve years old, but ye would not come. I invited you when you were thirty years old, but ye would not come. I invited you when you were ſixty years old, and ye would not come. What will ye anſwer to this? Have ye any thing to ſay? Or muſt ye not ſtand ſpeechleſs before your Judge, when

                     <hi>Conſideration</hi> 1. If ye embrace not Chriſt now, death will be very unpleaſant to you. O what elſe can comfort thee, when going through the region of death, but this, <hi>I am Chriſts, I am Chriſts?</hi> Is there any other thing can comfort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>Conſideration</hi> 2. If ye embrace not Chriſt and the great Salvation now, it will be an hundred to one if ever ye get time or liberty to do it, when ye are going to dye. For although many delay their cloſing with Chriſt till death, yet ſcarcely one of a hundred getteth favor to grip Chriſt at death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therefore think on it; for you will not get your mind ſo compoſed at death, as ye imagine, nor all things done, as ye ſuppoſe: therefore now em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the great Salvation.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>Conſideration</hi> 3. If ye delay your cloſing with Chriſt till death ſeize upon you, ye ſhal never be able to make up that loſs. <hi>For will the dead riſe and praiſe God? Or ſhal any one come from the Land of forgetfulneſs, to take hold upon a crucified Savior?</hi> Therefore, O will ye take him for your Salvation.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <hi>Conſideration</hi> 4. If ye will take Chriſt now, he ſhal be your guide when <hi>ye are going thorow the valley and ſhadow of death.</hi> And, O how bleſſed is the perſon that can ſing that word, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 48.14. <hi>This is my God, he will be my guide even unto death.</hi> If ye can ſing that pleaſant ſong, O how may ye be comforted when your eye-ſtrings ſhal begin to
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:178801:112"/> break! O how happy is he who can ſay, <hi>Though I walk thorow the ſhadow of death, yet will I fear no ill; for I know that the Lord is with me!</hi> Now this is the acceptable day, and the year of Salvation: therefore, do not delay, but embrace Chriſt, leſt death ſurpriſe you ere ye be aware, and ſo the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable day be loſt. But unto theſe who think they may delay till death, I ſay, ſurely there are many damned Atheiſts in hell that (ſometimes) did think as ye think, <hi>I will make all wrongs right when death and I ſhal meet:</hi> I hope that three days repentance will ſatisfy for all my wrongs; for I am ſure there are many in hell, who did never get three days to think upon their former wayes. Therefore, O come, come and embrace Chriſt preſently. Now are ye all perſwaded of this truth, that ye ſhal once ſee death? Then ſtudy a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der walking; for, believe me, there are many of us that ſhal go thorow death with many bruiſed bones, becauſe of untender walking before God: We know it is not the multitude of words can perſwade you to embrace Chriſt, for many of you never minded the thing; but believe me, death will preach theſe things unto you in a more terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner then we can do at this time. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay to each of you, O prepare to meet thy God, for if death find you in an eſtranged eſtate from God, I defie the Angels in Heaven to free you out of that eſtate; and the day is coming, wherein thou ſhalt cry out, <hi>O ſlighter of the great Salvation that I am, I would give ten thouſand
